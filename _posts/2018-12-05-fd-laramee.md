We are glad to announce that François Dominic Laramée has joined the editorial board of the _Programming Historian_.  

François Dominic is a doctoral candidate in History at the Université de Montréal, in Canada. As the holder of master’s degrees in both History and Computer Science, he was naturally drawn to the application of computational methods to the study of the past. His thesis examines the production of space, place and imagined geographies during the long eighteenth century, through textual analysis of large French-language corpora. His work has recently been published in the historical journal _Revue d’histoire de l’Amérique française_, in the information science journal _Document numérique_ and in _The Programming Historian_. Other research interests include the histories of the Early Modern Atlantic world and the native peoples of North America. 

Prior to starting his PhD in his mid-forties, he worked as a technology and geek culture columnist, screenwriter, television actor, stand-up comedy writer, and in various creative and business roles in the video game industry.

François Dominic's joining the project is also a valuable addition to the French-speaking team of the _Programming Historian_ and we look forward to working with him. As this also brings closer the realisation of the _Programming Historian en français_, we tell you _à très bientôt_!
