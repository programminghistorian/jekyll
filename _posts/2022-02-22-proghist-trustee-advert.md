## Role: Trustee ProgHist Ltd

* ProgHist Ltd, publisher of Programming Historian
* Salary: voluntary
* Term: 3-year appointment
* Location: Remote
* Candidates welcome from anywhere in the world
	

### Role Description

http://programminghistorian.org

The *Programming Historian* project is a world leading pedagogy and digital methods initiative that was the first publication of its kind dedicated to making digital humanities skills accessible to learners anywhere in the world, for free. The project now publishes in four languages ([English](https://programminghistorian.org/en/), [Spanish](https://programminghistorian.org/es/), [French](https://programminghistorian.org/fr/), [Portuguese](https://programminghistorian.org/es/)), each of which is supported by a team of academics working in digital humanities. These four journals have published more than 150 peer-reviewed tutorials, reaching more than 2 million readers per year, and that number continues to grow. *Programming Historian* was founded in 2008. In 2019 ProgHist Ltd was incorporated as a not-for-profit organisation and as a charity in 2021, to offer professional publishing support to its publications, which enjoy editorial independence. It currently employs two members of staff and is responsible to a wider membership of scholars based around the world. 

We are seeking a new board member to support the professional services team of ProgHist Ltd, and to help shape the strategy of the publishing organisation for the future. You will have a passion for open publishing and open learning, and experience contributing to a culturally and linguistically diverse team. Whilst we welcome expressions of interest from all candidates, we are particularly keen to hear from applicants with the following knowledge and experience, as well as those who speak Spanish, French, or Portuguese as a first language:

*	Publishing
*	Library and Collection Services
*	Financial Planning
*	Education

Trustees serve for a three-year term and all time is given voluntarily. Meetings take place remotely approximately five times per year, usually in the afternoon (UK time) to accommodate our international colleagues. Trustees may be asked to provide hands-on advice or knowledge from time to time to support new initiatives or those within their specific area of expertise.

The role of a trustee of a charity registered in England and Wales is outlined in the government’s ‘Essential Trustee’: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-essential-trustee-what-you-need-to-know-cc3

The *Programming Historian* team is committed to diversity, and we insist on a harassment-free space for all contributors to the project, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or technical experience. The candidate will be expected to champion these values.
