Hi. I'm Gisele Almeida and I'm the new Education & Community Lead at _Programming Historian_. 

I'll be supporting our multilingual publishing teams by delivering community-facing activities to better support our community of educators, learners, and project partners in their use of _Programming Historian_ resources. This will include hosting virtual events, training educators, and strengthening relationships with our supporting organisations—as well as fostering new partnerships.

I am excited at the prospect of working with such a diverse team. I have worked with – and learned from – academics and practitioners from different backgrounds and disciplines in the past and look forward to joining in on the conversation at _Programming Historian_ to help foment a long-lasting community of digital humanities learners and supporters.

I am a historian working on theoretical and methodological debates in the fields of history and disputed memories. My research emphasises historical representations constructed by social and political discourses and their implications for democracy, public opinion and social cohesion. I am originally from Brazil and my research focuses on memory politics in that country. My first monograph _Politics of Memory in Brazil: from Cardoso to Bolsonaro_ is forthcoming from Liverpool University Press. It is based on the research I did during my PhD in History at Ghent University, in Belgium. Prior to that I read Contemporary Philosophy for my MA at the University of Barcelona, in Spain. I completed my BA in History in Brazil, at Londrina State University. I speak Portuguese, English and Spanish.
