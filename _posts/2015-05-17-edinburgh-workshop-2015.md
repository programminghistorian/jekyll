__Programming Historian__ editor, Adam Crymble, will be leading a free 'Python for Humanities Research' workshop at the University of Edinburgh on 26 May 2015 as part of the '[Digital Day of Ideas](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/digital-day-of-ideas-2015-tickets-16428789953)'. 

Registration for the event and the workshop are both free, but space is limited so interested parties are encouraged to book as soon as possible.

Other speakers for the event include Ben Schmidt (Northeastern University), Anouk Lang (University of Edinburgh), and Ruth Ahnert (Queen Mary University).

It's a great way to get your toes wet with some Python, meet people interested in taking on similar challenges, and if you're lucky, maybe even get a Programming Historian sticker.

Register for free at: [Digital Day of Ideas](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/digital-day-of-ideas-2015-tickets-16428789953).
