Programming Historian Live will take place on Monday 19 October in the British Library Conference Centre (Bronte room). Based on a selection of the open access, peer reviewed tutorials at [The Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/) this hands-on workshop will provide introductory software training with a focus on the needs and requirements of the historians. It will be lead by historians and cover tools, software, and computational approaches historians use in their research. The workshop is free to attend and is aimed at postgraduate and early-career historians, though historians of all career stages are welcome to attend.

The provisional schedule will include introductions to:

- Data Structures (Extensible Markup Language, Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation)
