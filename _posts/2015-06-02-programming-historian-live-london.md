Based on a selection of the open access, peer reviewed tutorials at [The Programming Historian](/) this hands-on workshop will provide introductory software training with a focus on the needs and requirements of the historians.

The provisional schedule will include introductions to:

- Data Structures (Extensible Markup Language, Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation)
