19 October 2015, the British Library, London.

One of the responsibilities of the British Library Digital Research team is to coordinate the British Library Digital Scholarship Training Programme: an internal programme that offers staff at the British Library hands-on, in person, one-day courses where they have the opportunity and space to delve into the key concepts, methods and tools that define todayâ€™s digital scholarship practice. Some efforts have been made to make materials from these courses available to external audience for self-learning (see [British Library Digital Scholarship Training Programme: a round-up of resources you can use](http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2014/10/british-library-digital-scholarship-training-programme-round-up-of-resources-you-can-use.html)). Although these materials have been well received, we believe there is demand for external training that is hands-on and in person.

As part of [my fellowship with the Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/fellows/james-baker) I plan to deliver external training to test this demand. Sessions will be aimed at postgraduate and early-career researchers, with one programme advertised to historians and [the other to the library and information studies community](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/city-november-2015/).

Using [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) as a model and The Programming Historian as a source, **Programming Historian Live** will introduce basic unix command line skills (counting, grep, regular expressions, named entity recognition), version control, data structures, and exemplar tools (Open Refine). Example tasks will use data and scenarios appropriate for historians. Principles of automation, data management, and structured programming constitute softer learning outcomes.

In order to accommodate 30/40 attendees for each session, individuals with a range of skill sets have been invited to lead portions of the day and support attendees when they run into difficulties. So far these include:

* Jonathan Blaney (Institute of Historical Research)
* Adam Crymble (University of Hertfordshire)
* Melodee Beals (Sheffield Hallum University)
* Peter Webster (Webster Research and Consulting Ltd)
* Cornelis Schilt (University of Sussex)

Booking will open late summer. If you are interested in getting involved as a trainer, have a cohort of postgraduate or early career historians you'd like to send along, or would like to express an interest in attending, please contact [james.baker@bl.uk](https://twitter.com/j_w_baker) for more info.

The event will be fully funded by the Software Sustainability Institute, and is supported by the British Library, Institute of Historical Research, and The Programming Historian.
