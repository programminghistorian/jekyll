Marie and Sofia will contribute as editors and translators to the Programming Historian en français. The French-speaking initiative, as the Spanish one, aims to build capacity in translating Programming Historian existing lessons to French as well as in introducing original lessons in French for the French speaking community. As part of our internationalisation strategy, the members of the French-speaking initiative will also work inline with the [Additional Language Sub Teams Policy](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/wiki/Additional-Language-Sub-Teams-Policy) and will actively support and promote the PH author [guidelines for a Global Audience](https://programminghistorian.org/en/author-guidelines).
