Members of the editorial board of The Programming Historian participated in the Digital Humanities Conference held in Mexico City, July 26 and 29 2018. 

One of our Spanish language editors, Maria José Afanador, presented the paper *The Programming Historian en español: Strategies and challenges for building a global DH community* in a panel called *Local DH, non-standardization*. The presentation, which was delivered in Spanish with bilingual slides, introduced PH to the audience, presented the progress of Spanish-language editorial team, discussed some data on the impact of the project, and reflected on the challenges of the project moving forward. 

The presentation discussed the achievements of the PH en español. Since its launch on March 2017, the Spanish-language team has translated 33 tutorials from English to Spanish with the support of a growing network of collaborators from countries such as Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and the United States. As the number of tutorials available in Spanish increased and the team worked to make PH known in Latin America and Spain, the number of sessions from Spanish-speaking countries in the PH en español website augmented dramatically. In just a year (May 2017 to May 2018), the number of new sessions from countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, increased in about 1000%.    

The growth of PH en español, has also brought about crucial discussions on the internationalization of the project. The challenges of translating and adapting PH tutorials into Spanish has led the team to consider the question of how to reach global audiences while making our tutorials accessible and meaningful in a range of cultural contexts. Expanding on this, the presentation reflected on the challeges of incentivating the production of Spanish-language original tutorials in regions such as Latin America, where the digital divide often means limited access to resources for building basic technlogical infrastructures for DH work. Moving forward, PH en español is holding a PH tutorial writing workshops which will bring Spanish-speaking scholars from North, Central, and South America in an effort to produce the first original Spanish-language tutorials.  

The paper was nominated to the [2018 Paul Fortier Prize](http://adho.org/announcements/2018/six-nominees-2018-paul-fortier-prize), a prize that is given for the best paper by a young scholar/early stage researcher at each annual conference. Although we did not win, we are proud to realize that the hard work of the editorial team of PH and its commitment with geographic and linguistic diversity its been recognized by the DH global community.
