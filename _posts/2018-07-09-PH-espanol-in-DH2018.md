Last month of the editorial board of The Programming Historian participated in the [2018 Digital Humanities Conference](https://dh2018.adho.org/en/), organized by the Association of Digital Humanities Organizations in conjunction with El Colegio de México, La Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), and La Red de Humanidades Digitales (RedHD). The conference was held in Mexico City, and this Latin American setting combined with conference theme of "Puentes/Bridges" provided an ideal opportunity to build knowledge around our Spanish language initiative.

One of our Spanish language editors, [Maria José Afanador](https://github.com/mariajoafana), presented the paper *[The Programming Historian en español: Strategies and challenges for building a global DH community](https://dh2018.adho.org/the-programming-historian-en-espanol-estrategias-y-retos-para-la-construccion-de-una-comunidad-global-de-hd/)* in a panel called *Local DH, non-standardization*. The presentation, which was delivered in Spanish with bilingual slides, introduced PH to the audience, presented the progress of Spanish-language editorial team, discussed some data on the impact of the project, and reflected on the challenges of the project moving forward. 

The presentation discussed the achievements of the Programming Historian en español. Since its launch on March 2017, the Spanish-language team has translated 33 tutorials from English to Spanish with the support of a growing network of collaborators from countries such as Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and the United States. As the number of tutorials available in Spanish increased and the team worked to make Programming Historian known in Latin America and Spain, the number of sessions from Spanish-speaking countries in the Programming Historian en español website augmented dramatically. In just a year (May 2017 to May 2018), the number of new sessions from countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, increased in about 1000%.    

The growth of the Programming Historian en español, has also brought about crucial discussions on the internationalization of the project. The challenges of translating and adapting Programming Historian tutorials into Spanish has [led the team to consider the question of how to reach global audiences while making our tutorials accessible and meaningful in a range of cultural contexts](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/651). Expanding on this, the presentation reflected on the challeges of incentivating the production of Spanish-language original tutorials in regions such as Latin America, where the digital divide often means limited access to resources for building basic technlogical infrastructures for DH work. Moving forward, the Programming Historian en español is [holding a Programming Historian tutorial writing workshop](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/convocatoria-taller-PH-espanol) which will bring together Spanish-speaking scholars from North, Central, and South America in an effort to produce the first original Spanish-language tutorials.

The paper was nominated to the [2018 Paul Fortier Prize](http://adho.org/announcements/2018/six-nominees-2018-paul-fortier-prize), a prize that is given for the best paper by a young scholar/early stage researcher at each annual conference. Although we did not win, we are proud to realize that the hard work of the editorial team of the Programming Historian and its commitment with geographic and linguistic diversity its been recognized by the DH global community.  

The conference was also an opportunity for the project team to meet, in many cases for the first time! The Programming Historian editors at DH2018 included [Marie Puren](https://github.com/mpuren), a member of our nascent [French language initiative](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues?q=french+label%3Afrench), who along with the rest of the project team distributed 200 [Programming Historian en español stickers](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/tree/gh-pages/_promo) to conference delegates.
