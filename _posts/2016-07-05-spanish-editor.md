Building on our commitment to diversity and access, [The Programming Historian]() is seeking a new team member to help us bring the project to 400-million Spanish speakers worldwide. We envisage this to include both cultivating of a Spanish-language community of users and contributors and facillitating the translation of existing resources. There is significant scope to make this role your own. This is a voluntary academic service position.

Adam Crymble (University of Hertfordshire) will offer support on the practices of The Programming Historian’s editorial approaches and policies, and the successful candidate will work with Caleb McDaniel (Rice University) to integrate the new resources into our existing website. In keeping with our commitment to diversity and access to digital humanities, the project team are particularly interested in hearing from women, members of any minority groups, and citizens of non-English speaking countries.

Launched in 2012, The Programming Historian offers more than 45 novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research. The Programming Historian is a volunteer-led initiative, controlled entirely by the ‘Editorial Board of the Programming Historian’ with the help of community contributors. It is not a legal entity, and does not currently receive direct funding from any source. Read our reviews:
