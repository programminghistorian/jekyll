As you may have noticed, we’ve changed the way we’ve structured lessons
on the Programming Historian. We’ve been working to include lessons
about a wider range of topics than our initial all-Python, all-the-time
version, and so we’re experimenting with ways to organize them.

We still have some kinks to work out with organization and display, and
we really appreciate your patience as we work through them. In the
meantime, by request, here’s a list of the lessons in their original
order:

**NOTE, 2017-03-17:** As many of these lessons and links have changed, not all of these links may be up-to-date. Our most up-to-date listing of lessons can be found on the [lesson directory](/lessons/).
