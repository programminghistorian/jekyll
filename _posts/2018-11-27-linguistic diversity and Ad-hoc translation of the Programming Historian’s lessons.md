One of the interesting findings of the [Programming Historian 2018 Community survey](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/programming-historian-community-survey) we conducted earlier this year, as part of our community engagement strategy, was that our readership expands and diversifies organically in terms of place of origin - from [India](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/programming-historian-india) to Russia and from Brazil, to Poland and Italy - and native language. This is of course a well-known aspect of open educational content: you never choose your readership – even if you have planned things differently.

When the Programming Historian launched its open access tutorials in digital methods and tools back in 2012, English was easily chosen as the main language: the editorial board was North American English-speaking historians, having in mind a readership similar to their English-speaking peers, and the initiative was initially funded by an American institution. 
But this is not, I am afraid, a project-specific strategy: “historically, DH has developed in a very anglophone environment as English became the language of the Internet (with ICANN) and the lingua franca of the Web (with the W3C Consortium), along with the domination of the ASCII code” (Mahony 2018: 372). Moving digital scholarship beyond the anglophone sphere has been and still is one of the biggest and constant claims of the Digital Humanities community, from the ADHO’s Multi-Lingualism and Multi-Culturalism Committee (MLMC) and the multilingual policies in place in DH conferences, to the emergence of national DH initiatives and associations with associated non-English publications, projects and activities (eg French, Nordic, Italian, Spanish). 

At the Programming Historian, as of 2016, linguistic diversity and multicultural inclusion sits at the core of our research, communication and pedagogical approach. We took [gender, ethnicity and origin balance](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/PH-commitment-to-diversity) as for our editorial board very seriously, by adopting a diversity policy to ensure that members from any one gender or any one nationality do not comprise more than 50% + 1 of the members on the board. As part of our internationalization strategy, we encourage authors to write for a [Global Audience](https://programminghistorian.org/en/author-guidelines) by making choices (methods, tools, primary sources, bibliography, standards) with multi-lingual readers in mind while also being aware of cultural differences. Since the 2017, we launched The Programming Historian en español, with Spanish translations of existing lessons (39 as for now) and original lessons in Spanish and we are also thrilled to preparing the launch of The Programming Historian en français. 

Although we are excited that The Programming Historian is now evolving by hosting new language initiatives, we are acknowledging the challenges that cross-cultural and multi-lingual endeavours might entail. The Programming Historian is a multi-lingual project involving a large team, and so translation requires extensive teamwork and coordination across our editorial team. Furthermore, as we are developing our lessons as openly reviewed open access scholarly publications of high standard, there is an extensive set of technical, administrative and operational policies in place (from peer review, technical infrastructure to ISSN), we need to make sure new language sub-teams joining the project are well aware of these policies and requirements and are prepared to adhere to these. To this end, we put in place the [Additional Language Sub Teams Policy](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/wiki/Additional-Language-Sub-Teams-Policy) and we are generally very careful when deciding to integrate a full translation initiative as it’s a big commitment for all of us ;-)

On the other hand, if you are you interested in translating a (part of a) Programming Historian lesson, one that you ’ve found e.g. particularly useful for your community of practice or for the class you are teaching, the procedure is much more easier and we actively support and encourage such ad-hoc translation initiatives. Needless to say, all of our lessons are published under the Creative Commons ‘Attribution’ licence (CC BY) and this allows others to distribute, remix, reuse and build upon the licensed work as long as the original source is credited. By choosing the most liberal of the CC licences (and taking the risk of use within the for-profit sector) we allow derivative works of the lessons, including translations, and we enable onward reuse.

**How to embark on an ad-hoc translation?**
- Choose a lesson you want to translate in a different language. As a starting point, you can either use the online version of the lesson or the md file from the github repo of the project.
-	You can always consult our [Author](https://programminghistorian.org/en/author-guidelines) or [Editor](https://programminghistorian.org/en/editor-guidelines) guidelines to get the spirit of our lessons’ structure, wording and overall style.
-	As ad-hoc translations are a spin-off of the PH and they are not (necessarily) need to fit to our infrastructure, the easiest and more obvious way to do it, is to translate it in using your own infrastructure and services, in order to fit your original purposes.
1.	Once you have a final version of the translation and you want to share it with the project, please do send us the file (preferably if you have a md file). We then going to customize the lesson and upload it as a translation version of the original one.
2.	If you don’t want to share the translation with us, please do provide us with a bit of information about the translation work itself (translators, institution, publication, purpose) for our own records and do let us know if you want us to place a small note about the translation at the lesson’s page.

**Why to embark on an ad-hoc translation ?**
Here are a couple of ideas 
-	As part of your class assignment 
o	students familiarise themselves with the methods- tools in question
o	translation challenges towards terminology 
-	As part of an edit-a-thon organised in your country/institution – invite us or let us know!
-	As an one – off contribution of a particularly interesting lesson for your local community
