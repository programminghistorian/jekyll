As part of our long project to solidify the _Programming Historian's_ position as a set of open-access, peer-reviewed publications, we've taken many steps to integrate our data into the larger scholarly ecosystem, including embedded citation metadata and ORCIDs for our lesson contributors.

Today we're proud to announce yet another step: all of our articles now have regsitered DOIs, or _Digital Object Identifiers).
