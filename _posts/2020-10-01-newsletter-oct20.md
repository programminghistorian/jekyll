Despite the circumstances, the *Programming Historian* team has continued to work slowly but steadily to continue our goal of offering lessons in digital methods for humanists, free of charge and in several languages. 

To all our users, thank you for relying and supporting us! 



## New PH Members

Our editorial board keeps evolving and growing in multiple directions. This summer (in the Norther hemisphere) or winter (in the Southern hemisphere) we have onboarded three editors for the English-language edition of the journal. Please, join us in welcoming Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla, Alex Werner-Colan and Nabeel Siddiqui! Ian Milligan, who was already part of the journal from 2014 to 2018, also joined the team as an ombudsperson. 

Part of the Portuguese-language journal team is also on board now! Joana Vieira, Josir Gomes, Danielle Sanches and Aracele Torres have joined Daniel Alves in the team and are working non-stop to launch *Programming Historian em português* very soon. 

Welcome all, bem vindos!



## First year anniversary of ProgHist Limited

As our Finance Manager James Baker reminded us on Twitter, ProgHist Limited has been running for a year now, since we established it as a not-for-profit company. This move allowed us to begin the redistribution of some of the volunteer labor into paid labor, in order to make the project more sustainable as we continue to grow. 

<img src="/images/blog/proghist-1-year-tweet.png" alt="Tweet de James Baker: It is the 1 year anniversary of the @ProgHist not-for-profit! We've been humbled by the contributions of the #dhist #digitalhumanities community, both personal and institutional. You enable us to grow, improve, and sustain the Programming Historian"/>

Thank you, James, for making this work possible!
