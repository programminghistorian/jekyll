Join us on the **5th of May**, at 16h00 (BST, [check your local time here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20220505T1500)) to hear a little bit more about the collaboration between [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org) (PH), [the National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk) and [Jisc](https://www.jisc.ac.uk), that will result in [the publication of seven new tutorials](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/articles-selected-ph-jisc-tna) all about computational analysis of large-scale humanities data.

During this event, we will have the authors of four of the selected articles giving us an exclusive preview of their work, along with a discussion and a reflection from the PH team on the challenges of publishing these tutorials while maintaining our commitment towards [sustainability](https://programminghistorian.org/en/author-guidelines#sustainable-writing), [openness](https://programminghistorian.org/en/author-guidelines#open-source-open-access) and writing for a [global audience](https://programminghistorian.org/en/author-guidelines#write-for-a-global-audience).

The event is free and open to everyone, but registration is required. To register and access the eventâ€™s programme, [click here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/computational-analysis-skills-for-humanities-data-tickets-318673630407).
