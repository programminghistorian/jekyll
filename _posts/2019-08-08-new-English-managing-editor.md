*Programming Historian* publishes novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching. The managing editor for *Programming Historian* in English is a voluntary leadership role which comes with it the ultimate authority for the publication. All editors report directly to the managing editor, who has the executive power to accept or reject any paper, and to intervene as they see appropriate in the peer review of any lesson under their remit.

They should be a strong voice and a spokesperson for their publication.
They are responsible for quality, and for managing expectations of editors, authors, and reviewers, as well as ensuring that all rules, policies, and relevant laws are followed by members of their team.

On a practical level, the duties include but are not limited to:

1.	Act as first point of contact for prospective authors and collaborators
2.	Solicit feedback on lesson proposals from the Editorial Board and inform author accordingly
3.	Assign editors to lessons in progress upon submission
4.	Monitor peer review process to ensure timely publication
5.	Manage disputes with editors where appropriate
6.	Take final decision on publication, and manage the final publication process as per the guidelines

The candidate will be supported by the rest of the team, which prides itself on creating a collegiate environment. We would be pleased to hear from candidates who also have an interest in supporting the project as a member of our technical team. The technical team is responsible for maintaining and extending the technical infrastructure of *Programming Historian*, including but not limited to the Jekyll/GitHub pages deployment, page template styling, and integration with 3rd-party services.
