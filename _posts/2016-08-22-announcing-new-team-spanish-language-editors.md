[The Programming Historian](/) is proud to announce its new team of Spanish language editors! 

In July, the PH editorial board announced a [call for applications](/posts/spanish-editor) from digital humanists who could help translate the site's growing library of peer-reviewed tutorials into Spanish. The goal: to make PH lessons more accessible to Spanish speakers and to begin expanding the PH community beyond the site's primary audience of English speaking scholars in North America and Europe. 

We received many excellent applications, and it was difficult to choose just one new editor. After speaking individually with the three finalists for the position, the editorial board decided to invite each of them to form a team whose primarily goal will be to build connections between Programming Historian, the Spanish speaking world, and the broader global community of digital humanities practitioners.

We are now very excited to announce that Maria José Afanador-Llach, Víctor Gayol, and Antonio Rojas Castro have each accepted the invitation. Without further ado, we present the newest members of the PH editorial board:  

[Maria José Afanador-Llach](https://twitter.com/mariajoafana) recently graduated with a PhD in Latin American History at the University of Texas at Austin. She is currently collaborating with colleagues in the [Fundación Histórica Neogranadina](http://neogranadina.org/en/), a non-profit organization digitizing endangered colonial archives in Colombia and promoting digital humanities projects. She has broad experience translating academic writing from English to Spanish, and is dedicated to cultivating digital scholarship initiatives in Latin America.

[Víctor Gayol](https://twitter.com/victor_gayol) is a researcher and professor at El Colegio de Michoacán, A.C. (CPI-CONACYT), México, with a PhD in History. He always encourages his graduate students to use computer resources as widely as possible in their doctoral research. He is interested in working with authors to improve and disseminate the possibilities of computer assisted research among Spanish-speaking scholars in History, and to build a network to explore the possibilities and limitations of big data analysis in Spanish and Hispanic-American archival repositories.

[Antonio Rojas Castro](https://twitter.com/RojasCastroA) holds a PhD in Humanities from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain. As part of his dissertation he built a digital critical edition of Luis de Góngora's Solitudes (currently in beta). In 2013 he created the [Grupo de Humanidades Digitales de Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/humanidades_digitales), and he is currently the Communication Coordinator for the [European Association for Digital Humanities (EADH)](http://eadh.org/).
