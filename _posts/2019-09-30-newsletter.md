In  June 2019, we started publishing a newsletter with a summary of our community's progress throughout the year as part of our communication strategies. The goal of this initiative is to keep our users informed of lessons and translations, changes in the editorial board, upcoming events organized by our editors and, in all, to keep nurturing a welcoming and multilingual digital humanities community. 

In this second newsletter we would like to highlight the following achievements, which would have been impossible without the help of our great community of editors, reviewers and users. 



## ProgHist Ltd, a Not for Profit Company Limited by Guarantee 

Last year [we announced](https://programminghistorian.org/en/support-us) our intention to seek financial support for the *Programming Historian* in order to grow, improve, and sustain our work. We are therefore delighted to announce that from 1 October 2019 ProgHist Ltd will be operational, a Not for Profit Company Limited by Guarantee (registered in England, Company Number [12192946](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/12192946)), the purpose of which is to administer our financial activities. We believe that having a legal and financial footing will enable us to:

- Maintain our infrastructure.

- Bring in professional services that enhance the quality of our publications.

- Improve our community outreach and internationalisation.

- Protect The Programming Historian from changes to service agreements of those ‘free’ services upon which we rely.

In the coming months, we will announce the mechanisms by which the community can financially support our work.



## New members

In order to achieve our goals of growing the project with translations and original lessons, [Martin Grandjean joined the team](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/welcome-martin-grandjean) of *Programming Historian en français*. Along his experience in research and teaching history and digital humanities, Martin is also a member of Humanistica (ADHO). 

Martin will reinforce the *Programming Historian en français* where he will contribute as an editor and translator. We wish him a very warm welcome! 



## PH en français seeks new editorials members

As a the French-speaking initiative receives more attention, the [*Programming Historian en français*team is looking for new members](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/call-for-fr-members) to join the editorial board. They are looking for motivated people, active in the field of digital humanities and who can dedicate time to the project according to the [privileges and responsibilities defined for members of the entire team](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/wiki/Privileges-and-Responsibilities-of-Membership). Ideally, the team wants to collect applications from the entire French-speaking world. Knowledge of English is essential, and that of Spanish will be appreciated. As the project is hosted on Github, training will be provided when needed. 

They will be accepting applications until October 10, 2019. 



## PH members busy at summer conferences

Some *Programming Historian* editorial board members have had the opportunity not just to present the work that we do in international conferences, but also to meet in person for the first time!

Antonio Rojas Castro, Anna-Maria Sichani and Sofia Papastamkou presented their poster "Designing Multilingual Digital Pedagogy Initiatives: The Programming Historian for English, Spanish, and French speaking DH Communities" at the [**DH 2019 Conference**](https://dh2019.adho.org) in Utrecht, The Netherlands, in July. At the same time, they participated in the pre-conference workshop "Accelerating DH Education", presenting "Three Challenges in Developing Open Multilingual DH Educational Resources: The Case of The Programming Historian".

A few days later, and on the other side of the pond at the [**ACH 2019 Conference**](http://ach2019.ach.org) in Pittsburgh, Maria José Afanador-Llach and Jennifer Isasi presented "Retos en la producción de tutoriales de HD en contextos hispanohablantes" which focused on the experience of reaching to the audience of *Programming Historian en español*. Attending the conference gave them the opportunity to also meet Matthew Lincoln and Brandon Walsh as well as introducing more people to the multilingual project.

Congratulations to everyone who presented at conferences during the summer!



## PH en español received the Premio HDH 2018

The Asociación de Humanidades Digitales Hispánicas or [Association of Hispanic DH recognized the *Programming Historian en español*](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/premio-hdh-2018) as one of the two **best pedagogical initiative developed during 2018**. The main goal of this prize is to recognize social and academic initiatves developed in the field of the digital humanities from the basis of an advancement of knowledge, critical thinking, and the development of teaching curricula in DH in Spanish. We would like to once again extend our appreciation to the HDH board for this award!

Antonio Rojas Castro and Jennifer Isasi will receive the award on October 23th during the [IV Congreso de la HDH (HDH2019)](https://eventos.uclm.es/24964/detail/iv-congreso-internacional-de-la-asociacion-de-humanidades-digitales-hispanicas.html) in Toledo, Spain.



## Farewell

It is with mixed feelings that we announce that Marie Puren is stepping down from the editorial board of the *Programming Historian*. [Puren joined the team in July 2018](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/FR-team) and her work was invaluable in the weeks prior to the launch of the French-speaking initiative of the project. Her contributions as editor and translator to build capacity in the digital humanities in the French speaking communities are very much appreciated. We all recognize her great companionship and we wish Puren the best of success in future endeavors.  

We'll miss having a wonderful colleague like you, Marie. Wishing you all the best!
