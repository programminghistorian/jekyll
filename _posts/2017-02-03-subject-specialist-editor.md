    The Programming Historian is looking for a new team member.</figcaption></figure></p>

 *The Programming Historian* () is seeking an editor to work actively to solicit and edit lessons in a specific area or areas within the digital humanities. These lessons will focus on the analysis and interpretation phase of the research process, helping readers to move from digital data to publishable research.


Themes might include (but are not limited to):
 
* Corpus Linguistics
* Geographic Analyses of geospatial data
* Network Analyses
* Image Analysis
* Visualisation and analysis of statistical data

There is significant scope to make this role your own. The editorial board will offer support on the practices of *The Programming Historian's* editorial approaches and policies. In keeping with our commitment to diversity and access to digital humanities, the project team are **particularly interested in hearing from women, members of any minority groups, and citizens of non-English speaking countries**.
 
Launched in 2012, *The Programming Historian* offers more than 50 novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research. *The Programming Historian* is a volunteer-led initiative, controlled entirely by the 'Editorial Board of the Programming Historian' with the help of community contributors. It is not a legal entity, and does not currently receive direct funding from any source. Read scholarly reviews of our site:

* Lincoln Mullen, '[Review of the Programming Historian](https://academic.oup.com/jah/article/103/1/299/1751315/The-Programming-Historian)', *The Journal of American History*, vol. 103, no. 1 (2016), pp. 299-301.
* Cameron Blevins, '[Review of the Programming Historian](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/review-of-the-programming-historian/)', *The Journal of Interactive Technology & Pedagogy*, vol. 8 (2015)

Interested candidates should submit a short 1-2 page CV and a 1-page expression of interest outlining your interests, experience, and vision for the theme, to Adam Crymble (adam.crymble@gmail.com) by 28 February 2017. Please direct any questions to Adam in the first instance. Please note that this is a VOLUNTEER ACADEMIC SERVICE POSITION and there is no salary or stipend associated with this role. We expect this role to involve no more than 10 hours of active effort per month.
 
[**Update for clarity on 10 Feb 2017 - We've had a few questions about the level of 'expertise' required in the subject specialty. We're looking for someone who is interested in a particular area of digital humanities and wants to develop our offering in that area. You do not have to be a world expert on the ins-and-outs of the area, but you have to be interested in it and broadly aware of the current trends/concerns/approaches used. We hope that clarifies**]
 
The Ideal Candidate:

* Subject-specific interest in thematic area
* Able to commit the role
* Self directed & reliable
* Understanding of academic publishing beyond one's own country
* Editorial experience
* Technical writing experience
