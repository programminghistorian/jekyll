PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A DRAFT AND NOT A LIVE POST. PLEASE DO NOT YET ACT ON THIS INFORMATION.
The *Programming Historian* is looking for passionate, creative, and committed volunteers to join our project team. Members of the Project Team work collaboratively with authors and readers to maintain our project's high standards and to reach new audiences with digital humanities scholarship. Our editorial board meets virtually each month to discuss the future of the project and to pursue new opportunities.

Project Team members fulfill many roles, ranging from working directly with authors and reviewers to facilitate new lesson creation, to community development, to technical manangement of the project website. In order to keep the project vibrant and relevant to new communities, we are interested in bringing in 0-3 new team members with digital humanities interests to take on one or more of the following roles.

1. **Spanish Language Editor**: We have had a number of people contact us about expanding the project into Spanish, through both translation and community development. If you are fluent in Spanish and English and are interested in this position, please see our [full Spanish Editor posting](Link to PDF description)

2. **Social Media Community Lead**: We are looking for someone to work with Evan Taparata to get the word out about the project. This includes through our Twitter account and blog. [Check out our Blog](/blog) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/proghist)

3. **Software Carpentry**: The team at [*Software Carpentry*](http://software-carpentry.org/) have built a reputation worldwide for high quality in-person technical workshops. They've been in touch and are looking to make connections with the digital humanities community and we agree that a partnership between the *Programming Historian* and *Software Carpentry* is good for everyone. We're looking for someone passionate about workshops and digital humanities to take the lead on this initiative.

4. **Lesson Editor**: Our project needs the hard work of editors to work with authors and reviewers to guide lessons through th editorial process. Most editors work with 1-3 authors at any given time, and each editor has his or her own area of interest and expertise, expanding our lessons offering in new directions.

In keeping with our commitment to diversity and access to digital humanities, the project team are particularly interested in hearing from women, members of any minority groups, and citizens of non-English speaking countries. Graduate/Postgraduate students and independent scholars are welcome. We are happy to give more information about what each of these roles would require, and even happier to hear from you about what you could bring to our team! If you are interested, please contact Adam Crymble in the first instance (adam.crymble@gmail.com). Please note that we expect to add between 0 and 3 new permanent team members this year.
