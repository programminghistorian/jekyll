Lesson Goals
------------

In this lesson you will learn how to create vector layers based on
scanned historical maps. In [Intro to Google Maps and Google Earth][]
you used vector layers and created attributes in Google Earth. We will
be doing the same thing in this lesson, albeit at a more advanced level,
using QGIS software.

Vector layers are, along with raster layers, one of the two basic types
of data structures that store data. Vector layers use the three basic
GIS features – lines, points, and polygons – to represent real-world
features in digital format. Points can be used to represent specific
locations, such as towns, buildings, events, etc. (the scale of your map
will determine what you represent as a point – in a map of a province, a
town would be a point, whereas in a map of a town, a building might be a
point). Lines can effectively represent features such as roads, canals,
railways, and so on. Polygons (effectively enclosed shapes with more
than a few sides) are used to represent more complex objects such as the
boundaries of a lake, country, or electoral riding (again, scale will
affect your choice – large buildings in a close-up map of a city might
be better represented as polygons than as points).

In this lesson you will be creating shapefiles (which are a type of
vector data) to represent the historical development of communities and
roads in Prince Edward Island. Each shapefile can be created as one of
the three types of features: line, point, polygon (though these features
can't be mixed within a shapefile) . Each feature you create in a
shapefile has a corresponding set of attributes, which are stored in an
attribute table. You will create features and learn how to modify them,
which involves not only the visual creation of the three types of
features, but also the modification of their attributes. To do so, we
will use the files from [Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers][]
concerning Prince Edward Island.

## Getting Started

Start by downloading the [PEI_Holland map][] to the project folder:

Open the file you saved at the end of [Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding
Layers][]. You should have the following layers in your Layers window:

-   PEI\_placenames
-   PEI\_highway
-   PEI HYDRONETWORK
-   1935 inventory\_region
-   coastline\_polygon
-   PEI-CumminsMap1927

Uncheck all of these layer except for PEI\_placenames,
coastline\_polygon and PEI\_CumminsMap1927

{% include figure.html filename="pei1.png" caption="Figure 1: Click to see full size image." %}

We are now going to add a second historical map as a raster layer.

{% include figure.html filename="pei2.png" caption="Figure 2" %}

-   under Layer on toolbar, choose Add Raster Layer (alternatively the
    same icon you see next to 'Add Raster Layer' can also be selected
    from tool bar)
-   find the file you have downloaded titled 'PEI\_HollandMap1798'
-   you will be prompted to define this layer's coordinate system. In
    the Filter box search for '2291' then in the box below select
    'NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince Edward Isl. Stereographic'
-   If you are not prompted to define the layer's coordinate system, you
    need to change a setting. Click Settings and then Options. Click CRS
    on the right hand menu and then choose 'Prompt for CRS' from the
    options below 'When a new layer is created, or when a layer is
    loaded that has no CRS'. Click OK. Remove the Holland Map (right
    click on it and click Remove) and try adding it again. This time you
    should be prompted for a CRS and you can select the NAD83 option
    (see above).

{% include figure.html filename="pei3.png" caption="Figure 3" %}

In previous steps you have selected and unselected layers in the Layers
window by checking and unchecking the boxes next to them. These layers
are organized in descending order of visibility – i.e. the layer at the
top is the top layer in your viewer window (provided it is selected).
You can drag the layers up and down in the Layer window to change the
order in which they will be visible on your viewing window. The
coastline\_polygon raster layer is currently not visible because it is
below the PEI\_HollandMap1798 and PEI\_Cummins1927 layers. In general it
is best to keep vector layers above the raster layers.

Uncheck PEI\_Cummins1927 so that the only layer you have remaining is
PEI\_HollandMap1798. Note that the map appears crooked on the screen;
this is because it has already been georeferenced by the lesson writers
to match the GIS vector layers. Learn more about georeferencing in
[Georeferencing in QGIS 2.0][].

{% include figure.html filename="pei4.png" caption="Figure 4" %}

We will now create a point shapefile, which is a vector layer. Click
Layer -\> New -\> New Shapefile Layer

-   alternatively you can select the New Shapefile Layer icon on the top
    of the QGIS toolbar window

{% include figure.html filename="pei5.png" caption="Figure 5" %}

After selecting New Shapefile Layer, a window titled New Vector Layer
appears

-   In the Type category, Point is already selected for you. Click the
    Specify CRS button, and select NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince Edward Isl.
    Stereographic (EPSG: 2291), and then click OK (for information on
    understanding and selecting UTM zone:
    <http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/locations/umd/digital/clump_classes.html>)

{% include figure.html filename="pei6.png" caption="Figure 6: Click to see full size image." %}

Returning to the New Vector Layer window, we are going to make some
attributes. To create the first attribute:

-   under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in
    'Settlement\_Name' (note that when working in databases you cannot
    use empty spaces in names so the convention is to use underscores in
    their place)
-   click Add to attributes list

Now we are going to create a second attribute:

-   under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in 'Year'
-   this time, we are going to change the Type to Whole Number
-   click Add to attribute list

For the third attribute:

-   under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in "End\_Year"
    (GIS is not always optimal for dealing with change over time, so in
    some cases it is important to have a field to identify approximately
    when something ceased to exist)
-   change the Type again to Whole Number
-   click Add to attribute list

{% include figure.html filename="pei7.png" caption="Figure 7" %}

-   When you complete these three steps, finish creating this shapefile
    by clicking OK on the bottom right of the New Vector Layer window. A
    pops up – name it 'settlements' and save it with your
    other GIS files.

Note that a layer called 'settlements' now appears in your Layers
window. Relocate it above the raster layers.

{% include figure.html filename="pei8.png" caption="Figure 8" %}

Uncheck all layers except settlements. You will notice that your viewing
window is now blank as we have not created any data. We will now create
new data from both the `PEI_HollandMap 1798` and the
`PEI_CumminsMap1927` to show the increase in settlement between the late
18th and early 20th centuries.

-   we will begin with the more recent, and thus usually more accurate,
    map. Reselect (i.e. check the boxes beside) coastline\_polygon and
    PEI\_CumminsMap1927
-   in your viewing window, zoom in to Charlottetown (hint:
    Charlottetown is near the middle of the island on the south side, at
    the confluence of three rivers)
-   select settlements layer in Layers window
-   on the menu bar, select Toggle Editing

{% include figure.html filename="pei9.png" caption="Figure 9" %}

-   After selecting Toggle Editing, editing buttons will become
    available to the right along the menu bar. Select the 3 dot feature
    button.

{% include figure.html filename="pei10.png" caption="Figure 10" %}

-   Your cursor now appears as a crosshair – point the crosshair at
    Charlottetown (if you don't happen to know PEI's geography, you can
    cheat by adding on the PEI\_placenames layer) keeping it within the
    modern day coastline, and click (digitization is always a compromise
    between accuracy and functionality; depending on the quality of the
    original map and the digitization, for most historical applications
    extreme accuracy is not necessary).
-   An Attributes window will appear. Leave id field blank (at time of
    writing, QGIS appears to be making two id fields and this one is
    unnecessary). In Settlement field, type in 'Charlottetown'. In the
    Year field type in 1764. Click OK

We will now repeat the steps we took with Charlottetown for Montague,
Summerside, and Cavendish (again, you can find these locations by adding
the PEI\_placenames layers). Find Montague on the map, select the 3 dot
feature button and click on Montague on the map. When the Attributes
window appears, input Montague and 1732 in the appropriate fields.
Repeat for Summerside (1876) and Cavendish (1790).

{% include figure.html filename="pei11.png" caption="Figure 11" %}

In the Layers window, unselect the PEI\_CumminsMap1927 and select
PEI\_HollandMap1798. We are now going to identify two settlements
(Princetown & Havre-St-Pierre) that no longer exist.

-   To locate Princetown, look for Richmond Bay and Cape Aylebsury (on
    the north coast to the west of Cavendish), here you will find
    Princetown (shaded-in) near the boundary between the yellow and the
    blue

-   If you look at the [Wikipedia entry][] for the city you will notice
    that because of a shallow harbor, Princetown did not become a major
    settlement. It was renamed in 1947 and later downgraded to a hamlet.
    For this reason we will include 1947 as the end date for this
    settlement.

-   With the crosshair click on Princetown. In the Attribute table that
    appears, put Princetown in the Settlement field, put 1764 into the
    Year field, and put 1947 into the End\_Year. Click OK

{% include figure.html filename="pei12.png" caption="Figure 12" %}

-   Click on Save Edits icon on the menu bar (it is between Toggle and
    Add Feature)

-   Double-click on settlements layer in the Layers window, choose
    Labels tab at the top of the ensuing window. Click on the box beside
    Display labels. In Field containing label select Year (if
    necessary), change font size to 18.0, change Placement to Above
    Left, and then click OK

On the northern coast of Lot 39 between Britain's Pond and St. Peters
Bay, we will now put a dot for the location of a long lost village
called Havre-St-Pierre.

-   Havre-St-Pierre was the island's first Acadian settlement but has
    been uninhabited since the Acadian deportation of 1758.

-   With the crosshair click on Havre-St. Pierre. In the Attribute table
    that appears, put Havre-St-Pierre in the Settlement field, put 1720
    into the Year field, and put 1758 into the End\_Year. Click OK

{% include figure.html filename="pei13.png" caption="Figure 13" %}

We will now now create another vector layer – this layer will be a line
vector. Click Layer -\> New -\> New Shapefile Layer. The New Vector
Layer window will appear (in the Type category at the top, select Line)

-   Click the Specify CRS button, and select NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince
    Edward Isl. Stereographic (EPSG: 2291), and then click OK
-   under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in 'Road\_Name'
-   click Add to attributes list

Create a second attribute

-   under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in Year
-   change the Type to Whole Number
-   click Add to attribute list
-   To finish creating this shapefile, click OK on the bottom right of
    the New Vector Layer window. A 'save' screen pops up – name it
    'roads' and save it with your other GIS files.

We are now going to trace the roads from the 1798 map so that we can
compare them to the modern roads. Make that you have the
PEI\_Holland1798 and settlements layers checked in the Layers window.
Select road layer in the layers window, select Toggle Editing on the top
toolbar, and then select Add Feature

{% include figure.html filename="pei14.png" caption="Figure 14" %}

-   First trace the road from Charlottetown to Princetown. Click on
    Charlottetown and then click repeatedly at points along the road to
    Princetown and you will see the line being created. Repeat until you
    arrive at Princetown, then right-click. In the resulting Attributes
    – road window, in the Name field enter "to Princetown" and in the
    Year field enter 1798. Click OK

{% include figure.html filename="pei15.png" caption="Figure 15" %}

-   repeat this step for 3 to 4 more roads found on the
    PEI\_HollandMap1798.
-   click Save Edits and then click Toggle Editing to turn it off

Deselect the PEI\_HollandMap1798 in the Layers window and select the
PEI\_highway map. Compare the roads represented in the PEI\_highway map
(the red dotted lines) to the roads you have just traced.

{% include figure.html filename="pei16.png" caption="Figure 16" %}

-   We can see that some of these roads correspond closely to modern
    roads, while others do not at all correspond. It would take further
    historical research to determine whether this is simply because the
    Holland map did not sufficiently survey roads at the time, or if
    roads have changed considerably since then.

Now create a third type of vector layer: a polygon vector. Click Layer
-\> New -\> New Shapefile Layer. The New Vector Layer window will appear
– in the Type category at the top, select Polygon

-   Click the Specify CRS button, and select NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince
    Edward Isl. Stereographic (EPSG: 2291), and then click OK
-   under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in 'lot\_name'
    in the field beside Year
-   click Add to attributes list

Create a second attribute

-   under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in Year
-   change the Type to Whole Number
-   click Add to attribute list

{% include figure.html filename="pei7.png" caption="Figure 17" %}

Start by creating a polygon for lot 66, which is the only rectangular
lot on the island

-   Click on Toggle Editing on top tool bar, and then click on Add
    Feature
-   click on all four corners of lot 66 and you will see a polygon
    created
-   right-click on the final corner and an Attributes window will
    appear. Add 66 to lot\_names field and add 1764 (the year these lots
    were surveyed) to the Year field

{% include figure.html filename="pei18.png" caption="Figure 18" %}

We are now going to trace lot 38, which is just west of Havre-St-Pierre.
Make sure that there is a check mark in the box beside
PEI\_HollandMap1798 layer in the Layers window

Click on Toggle Editing on top tool bar, and then click on Add Feature

Trace the outline of Lot 38, which is more difficult because of the
coastline, as accurately as possible. In order to show you the Snap
feature, we want you to trace along the modern coastline (snapping is
an automatic editing operation that adjusts the feature you have drawn
to coincide or lineup exactly with the coordinates and shape of another
nearby feature)

-   select Settings-\> Snapping Options

{% include figure.html filename="pei19.png" caption="Figure 19" %}

-   a Snapping options window will open: click on the box beside
    coastal\_polygon, for the Mode category select "to vertex and
    segment", for Tolerance select 10.0, and for Units select 'pixels'.
    Click OK

{% include figure.html filename="pei20.png" caption="Figure 20" %}

Make sure that the lots layer is selected in Layers window, and select
Add Feature from the tool bar

-   with your cursor click on the two bottom corners of your polygon
    just as you did with Lot 38. At the coastline you will notice that
    you have a collection of lines to trace around Savage Harbour. This
    is where the Snapping features becomes helpful. As you work to trace
    along the modern coastline it will significantly improve your
    accuracy by snapping your clicks directly on top of the existing
    line. The more clicks you make the more accurate it will be, but
    keep in mind that for many HGIS purposes obtaining extreme accuracy
    sometimes produces diminishing returns.

{% include figure.html filename="pei21.png" caption="Figure 21" %}

When you finish tracing and creating the polygon, select and deselect
the various layers you have created, comparing and seeing what
relationships you can deduce.

In Google Earth there were limitations on the types of features,
attributes, and data provided by Google, and Google Earth did much of
the work for you. That is fine when you are learning or want to quickly
create maps. The advantage of using QGIS software to create new vector
layers is that you have a great deal of freedom and control over the
types of data you can use and the features and attributes that you can
create. This in turn means that you can create custom maps far beyond
what can be achieved in Google Earth or Google Maps Engine Lite. You
have seen this firsthand with the points, lines, and polygons vector
layers you learned how to create in this lesson. If you found data on,
for example, public health records in the 18th century, you could create
a new layer to work with what you already created showing the
distribution of typhoid outbreaks and see if there are correlations with
major roads and settlements. Moreover, GIS software allows you to not
only spatially represent and present data in much more sophisticated
ways, but to analyze and create new data in ways that aren't possible
otherwise.

**You have learned how to create vector layers. Make sure you save your
work!**
