Lesson Goals
------------

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use python with the Zotero API to
interact with your Zotero library. The Zotero API is a powerful
interface that would allow you to build a complete Zotero client from
scratch if you so desired. But like most APIs, it works in small,
discrete steps, so we have to build our way up to the complicated
requests we might want to use to access our Zotero libraries. But this
incremental building gives us plenty of time to learn as we go along.

### What is Zotero?

Zotero is a browser-based research tool that allows you to collect and
store content. If you are new to Zotero or do not regularly use it, you
may want to familiarize yourself with the [Zotero][] site and its
helpful [Quick Start Guide][]. Additionally, while you will not need it
for this introductory lesson, we advise that you download the current
version of the [libZotero GitHub library][] and store it in the
directory you have chosen to use for these lessons.

### Installing libZotero

Using what you learned in the lesson on [Installing Python Modules with pip][],
we'll use [pip][] to install libZotero, a python library that
will allow us to interact with the Zotero API. To install the library,
in your command line/terminal window (use Powershell on Windows) enter:

```
pip install libZotero
```

Remember that you may need to use the `sudo` preface and enter your
password to allow the installation to proceed.

### Zotero Hello World

Once *libZotero* is installed, we can use it to talk to the Zotero server
using Python. In your text editor, open a new, blank text file, and begin with the following:

``` python
#make the libZotero library available
from libZotero import zotero
```

Once we've successfully imported the name zotero from the library, we
can create and define a Zotero library "object" (*zlib*, in this example),
which will be our means of creating a request for the Zotero server and
returning its data. When we create the library object we will need to
specify whether we're accessing an individual or group library and
include the Zotero library's ID number. Depending on the type of library
we're accessing and the things we plan to do with it, we may also need
to include an authentication key, which functions sort of like a
password.

``` python
#create Zotero library object called "zlib"
zlib=zotero.Library('group','<insert group ID>','<null>',
'<insert API key>')
```

For this lesson, you can use your own group or individual library, or
you can use the library we’ve created for this lesson at [Programming
Historian 2][].

If you want to use your own group or individual library, you will need
to retrieve your group or user ID and your own API key. If you use your
individual library, you'll also need to replace the word `group` with the
word `user` in the above code.

Your group ID can be found by hovering over the RSS option on your library
feed. The ID is the numeric part of the URL. Your group API key, if one has
been created, is located in your [account settings][]. If there is no key
assigned to the group, and you are the end user, you can create a new key on
the same page.

To use the PH2 group library, use the following:

```
Group ID: 155975
API key: 9GLmvmZ1K1qGAz9QWcdlyf6L
```

``` python
zlib=zotero.Library('group','155975','<null>',
'9GLmvmZ1K1qGAz9QWcdlyf6L')
```

Once we've defined our object, we can use it to interact with the
information in the library.

### Retrieving Item Information

Zotero has parent items and child items. Parents are typically top-level
objects with metadata, and children are usually things like notes and
file attachments. For this portion of the lesson, we'll be pulling
information from the first five top-level items in our collection.

``` python
# retrieve the first five top-level items.
items = zlib.fetchItemsTop({'limit': 5, 'content': 'json,bib,coins'})
```

Your output for this step, if you are using our sample collection,
should look like this:

``` xml
value stored in cache - https://api.zotero.org/groups/155975/items/top?limit=5&content=
json%2Cbib%2Ccoins&key=9GLmvmZ1K1qGAz9QWcdlyf6L
```

Next, we can print some basic information about these items.

``` python
# print some data about these five items
for item in items:
  print('Item Type: %s | Key: %s | Title: %s' % (item.itemType,
item.itemKey, item.title))
```

This step should retrieve the item type (journal article, webpage,
etc.), the key, and item title.

``` xml
Item Type: webpage | Key: TK5Z4H9J | Title: Benjamin Bowsey
Item Type: webpage | Key: 3A2RWZ8A | Title: Y a t-il une
Histoire Numerique 2.0?
Item Type: webpage | Key: 79U2EACW | Title: Digitization
boosts access, collaboration, UCLA prof says
Item Type: journalArticle | Key: 39V7A2SZ | Title: History
and the second decade of the Web
Item Type: journalArticle | Key: JRCM2PM7 | Title: The
Pasts and Futures of Digital History
```

We can also pull the bibliographic information associated with our first
five items:

``` python
for item in items:
  print(item.bibContent)
```

Running this command will print the bibliographic content stored on the
Zotero servers for these items:

``` xml
<div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 1.35; padding-left: 2em; text-indent:-2em;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

If you are using Windows Terminal instead of Powershell and you get an error that starts with "UnicodeEncodeError", see this [explanation and instructions](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/win_unicode_console).

Now that we have worked through retrieving information using the Zotero
API, we can continue to use it to interact with the items stored in our
library.
