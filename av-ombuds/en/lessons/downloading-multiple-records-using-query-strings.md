## Module Goals

Downloading a single record from a website is easy, but downloading many
records at a time – an increasingly frequent need for a historian – is
much more efficient using a programming language such as Python. In this
lesson, we will write a program that will download a series of records
from the [Old Bailey Online][] using custom search criteria, and save
them to a directory on our computer. This process involves interpreting
and manipulating URL *Query Strings*. In this case, the tutorial will seek
to download sources that contain references to people of African descent
that were published in the *Old Bailey Proceedings* between 1700 and 1750.

## For Whom is this Useful?

Automating the process of downloading records from an online database
will be useful for anyone who works with historical sources that are
stored online in an orderly and accessible fashion and who wishes to
save copies of those sources on their own computer. It is particularly
useful for someone who wants to download many specific records, rather
than just a handful. If you want to download *all* or *most* of the
records in a particular database, you may find Ian Milligan’s tutorial
on [Automated Downloading with WGET][] more suitable.

The present tutorial will allow you to download discriminately,
isolating specific records that meet your needs. Downloading multiple
sources automatically saves considerable time. What you do with the
downloaded sources depends on your research goals. You may wish to
create visualizations or perform various data analysis methods, or
simply reformat them to make browsing easier. Or, you may just want to
keep a backup copy so you can access them without Internet access.

This lesson is for intermediate Python users. If you have not already tried the [Python Programming Basics][] lessons, you may find that a useful starting point.

## Applying our Historical Knowledge

In this lesson, we are trying to create our own corpus of cases related
to people of African descent. From [Benjamin Bowsey’s case][] at the Old Bailey in 1780, we might note that “black” can be a useful keyword for us to use for locating other
cases involving defendants of African descent. However, when we search for “black” on the Old Bailey website, we
find it often refers to other uses of the word: black horses, or black
cloth. The task of disambiguating this use of language will have to wait
for another lesson. For now, let’s turn to easier cases. As historians,
we can probably think of keywords related to African descendants that
would be worth pursuing. The infamous “n-word” of course is not useful,
as this term did not come into regular usage until the mid-nineteenth
century. “Negro” and “mulatto” are however, much more relevant to the
early eighteenth century. These keywords are less ambiguous than “black”
and are much more likely to be immediate references to people in our
target demographic. If we try these two terms in separate simple
searches on the Old Bailey website, we get results like in these
screenshots:

{% include figure.html filename="SearchResultsNegro.png" caption="Search results for 'negro' in the Old Bailey Online" %}

{% include figure.html filename="SearchResultsMulatto.png" caption="Search results for 'mulatto' in the Old Bailey Online" %}

After glancing through these search results, it seems clear that these
are references to people, rather than horses or cloth or other things
that may be black. We want to download them all to use in our analysis.
We could, of course, download them one at a time, manually. But let’s
find a programmatic way to automate this task.

## The Advanced Search on OBO

Every website’s search features work differently. While searches work
similarly, the intricacies of database searches may not be entirely
obvious. Therefore it’s important to think critically about database
search options and, when available, read the documentation provided on
the website. Prudent historical researchers always interrogate their
sources; the procedures behind your search boxes should receive the same
attention. The Old Bailey Online’s [advanced search form][] lets you
refine your searches based on ten different fields including simple
keywords, a date range, and a crime type. As each website’s search
feature is different it always pays to take a moment or two to play with
and read about the search options available. Since
we have already done the simple searches for “negro” and “mulatto”, we
know there will be results. However, let’s use the advanced search to
limit our results to records published in the Old Bailey Proceedings
trial accounts from 1700 to 1750 only. You can of course change this to
whatever you like, but this will make the example easier to follow.
Perform the search shown in the image below. Make sure you tick the
“Advanced” radio button and include the `*` wildcards to include
pluralized entries or those with an extra “e” on the end.

{% include figure.html filename="AdvancedSearchExample.png" caption="Old Bailey Advanced Search Example" %}

Execute the search and then click on the “Calculate Total” link to
see how many entries there are. We now have 13 results (if you have a
different number go back and make sure you copied the example above
exactly). What we want to do at this point is download all of these
trial documents and analyze them further. Again, for only 13 records,
you might as well download each record manually. But as more and more
data comes online, it becomes more common to need to download 1,300 or
even 130,000 records, in which case downloading individual records
becomes impractical and an understanding of how to automate the process
becomes that much more valuable. To automate the download process, we
need to step back and learn how the search URLs are created on the Old
Bailey website, a method common to many online databases and websites.

## Understanding URL Queries

Take a look at the URL produced with the last search results page. It
should look like this:

```
https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?gen=1&form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext=mulatto*+negro*&kwparse=advanced&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount&fromYear=1700&fromMonth=00&toYear=1750&toMonth=99&start=0&count=0
```

We had a look at URLs in [Viewing HTML Files][], but this looks a lot
more complex. Although longer, it is actually *not* that much more
complex. But it is easier to understand by noticing how our search
criteria get represented in the URL.

```
https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp
?gen=1
&form=searchHomePage
&_divs_fulltext=mulatto*+negro*
&kwparse=advanced
&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount
&fromYear=1700
&fromMonth=00
&toYear=1750
&toMonth=99
&start=0
&count=0
```

In this view, we see more clearly our 12 important pieces of information
that we need to perform our search (one per line). On the first is the
Old Bailey’s base website URL, followed by a query: “?” (don’t worry
about the `gen=1` bit; the developers of the Old Bailey Online say that
it does not do anything.) and a series of 10 *name/value pairs* put
together with & characters. Together these 10 name/value pairs comprise
the query string, which tells the search engine what variables to use in
specific stages of the search. Notice that each name/value pair contains
both a variable name: toYear, and then assigns that variable a value: 1750.
This works in exactly the same way as *Function Arguments* by
passing certain information to specific variables. In this case, the
most important variable is `_divs_fulltext=` which has been given the
value:

```
mulatto*+negro*
```

This holds the search term we have typed into the search box. The
program has automatically added a + sign in place of a blank space (URLs
cannot contain spaces); otherwise that’s exactly what we’ve asked the
Old Bailey site to find for us. The other variables hold values that we
defined as well. *fromYear* and *toYear* contain our date range. Since no
year has 99 months as suggested in the *toMonth* variable, we can assume
this is how the search algorithm ensures all records from that year are
included. There are no hard and fast rules for figuring out what each
variable does because the person who built the site gets to name them.
Often you can make an educated guess. All of the possible search fields
on the Advanced Search page have their own name/value pair. If you’d
like to find out the name of the variable so you can use it, do a new
search and make sure you put a value in the field in which you are
interested. After you submit your search, you’ll see your value and the
name associated with it as part of the URL of the search results page.
With the Old Bailey Online, as with many other websites, the search form
(advanced or not) essentially helps you to construct URLs that tell the
database what to search for. If you can understand how the search fields
are represented in the URL – which is often quite straightforward – then
it becomes relatively simple to programmatically construct these URLs
and thus to automate the process of downloading records.

Now try changing the “**start=0**” to “**start=10**” and hit enter. You
should now have results 11-13. The “start” variable tells the website
which entry should be shown at the top of the search results list. We
should be able to use this knowledge to create a series of URLs that
will allow us to download all 13 files. Let’s turn to that now.

## Systematically Downloading Files

In [Working with Webpages][] we learned that Python can download a
webpage as long as we have the URL. In that lesson we used the URL to
download the trial transcript of Benjamin Bowsey. In this case, we’re
trying to download multiple trial transcripts that meet the search
criteria we outlined above without having to repeatedly re-run the
program. Instead, we want a program that will download everything we
need in one go. At this point we have a URL to a search results page
that contains the first ten entries of our search. We also know that by
changing the “start” value in the URL we can sequentially call each
search results page, and ultimately retrieve all of the trial documents
from them. Of course the research results don’t give us the trial
documents themselves, but only links to them. So we need to extract the
link to the underlying records from the search results. On the Old
Bailey Online website, the URLs for the individual records (the trial
transcript files) can be found as links on the search results pages. We
know that all trial transcript URLs contain a trial id that takes the
form: “t” followed by at least 8 numbers (e.g. t17800628-33). By looking
for links that contain that pattern, we can identify trial transcript
URLs. As in previous lessons, let’s develop an algorithm so that we can
begin tackling this problem in a manner that a computer can handle. It
seems this task can be achieved in four steps. We will need to:

-   Generate the URLs for each search results page by incrementing the
    “start” variable by a fixed amount an appropriate number of times.
-   Download each search results page as an HTML file.
-   Extract the URLs of each trial transcript (using the trial ID as
    described above) from the search results HTML files.
-   Cycle through those extracted URLs to download each trial transcript
    and save it to a directory on our computer

You’ll recall that this is fairly similar to the tasks we achieved in
[Working with Webpages][] and [From HTML to a List of Words 2][]. First
we download, then we parse out the information we’re after. And in this
case, we download some more.

### Downloading the search results pages

First we need to generate the URLs for downloading each search results
page. We have already got the first one by using the form on the
website:

```
https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?gen=1&form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext=mulatto*+negro*&kwparse=advanced&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount&fromYear=1700&fromMonth=00&toYear=1750&toMonth=99&start=0&count=0
```

We could type this URL out twice and alter the ‘*start*’ variable to get
us all 13 entries, but let’s write a program that would work no matter
how many search results pages or records we had to download, and no
matter what we decide to search for. Study this code and then add this
function to a module named `obo.py` (create a file with that name and save it to the directory where you want to do your work). The comments in the code are meant to
help you decipher the various parts.

``` python
# obo.py
def getSearchResults(query, kwparse, fromYear, fromMonth, toYear, toMonth):

    import urllib.request

    startValue = 0

    #each part of the URL. Split up to be easier to read.
    url = 'https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?gen=1&form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext='
    url += query
    url += '&kwparse=' + kwparse
    url += '&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount'
    url += '&fromYear=' + fromYear
    url += '&fromMonth=' + fromMonth
    url += '&toYear=' + toYear
    url += '&toMonth=' + toMonth
    url += '&start=' + str(startValue)
    url += '&count=0'

    #download the page and save the result.
    response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
    webContent = response.read()
    filename = 'search-result'
    f = open(filename + ".html", 'wb')
    f.write(webContent)
    f.close
```

In this function we have split up the various Query String components
and used Function Arguments so that this function can be reused beyond
our specific needs right now. When we call this function we will replace
the arguments with the values we want to search for. We then download
the search results page in a similar manner as done in [Working with
Webpages][]. Now, make a new file: `download-searches.py` and copy into
it the following code. Note, the values we have passed as arguments are
exactly the same as those used in the example above. Feel free to play
with these to get different results or see how they work.

``` python
#download-searches.py
import obo

query = 'mulatto*+negro*'

obo.getSearchResults(query, "advanced", "1700", "00", "1750", "99")
```

When you run this code you should find a new file:
“`search-results.html`” in your `programming-historian directory`
containing the first search results page for your search. Check that
this downloaded properly and then delete the file. We’re going to adapt
our program to download the other page containing the other 3 entries at
the same time so we want to make sure we get both. Let’s refine our
`getSearchResults` function by adding another function argument called
“entries” so we can tell the program how many pages of search results we
need to download. We will use the value of entries and some simple math
to determine how many search results pages there are. This is fairly
straightforward since we know there are ten trial transcripts listed per
page. We can calculate the number of search results pages by dividing
the value of entries by 10. We will save this result to a
variable named `pageCount`. It looks like this:

``` python
#determine how many files need to be downloaded.
pageCount = entries / 10
```

However, in cases where the number of entries is not a multiple of 10,
this will result in a decimal number. You can test this by
running this code in your Terminal (Mac & Linux) / Python Command Line
(Windows) and printing out the value held in `pageCount`. (Note, from here
on, we will use the word Terminal to refer to this program).

``` python
entries = 13
pageCount = entries / 10
print(pageCount)
-> 1.3
```

We know the page count should be 2 (one page containing entries 1-10, and one
page containing entries 11-13). Since we always want the next higher integer,
we can round up the result of the division.

``` python
#determine how many files need to be downloaded.
import math
pageCount = entries / 10
pageCount = math.ceil(pageCount)
```

If we add this to our `getSearchResults` function just under the
*startValue = 0* line, our program, the code can now calculate the number
of pages that need to be downloaded. However, at this stage it will
still only download the first page since we have only told the
downloading section of the function to run once. To correct this, we can
add that downloading code to a for loop which will download once for
every number in the `pageCount` variable. If it reads 1, then it will
download once; if it reads 5 it will download five times, and so on.
Immediately after the if statement you have just written, add the
following line and indent everything down to `f.close` one additional
tab so that it is all enclosed in the for loop:

``` python
for pages in range(1, pageCount+1):
    print(pages)
```

Since this is a for loop, all of the code we want to run repeatedly
needs to be intended as well. You can see if you have done this
correctly by looking at the finished code example below. This loop takes
advantage of Python’s [range][] funciton. To understand this for loop it
is probably best to think of `pageCount` as equal to 2 as it is in the
example. This two lines of code then means: start running with an
initial loop value of 1, and each time you run, add 1 more to that
value. When the loop value is the same as `pageCount`, run once more and
then stop. This is particularly valuable for us because it means we can
tell our program to run exactly once for each search results page and
provides a flexible new skill for controlling how many times a for loop
runs. If you would like to practice with this new and powerful way of
writing for loops, you can open your Terminal and play around.

``` python
pageCount = 2
for pages in range(1, pageCount+1):
    print(pages)

-> 1
-> 2
```

Before we add all of this code together to our `getSearchResults`
function, we have to make two final adjustments. At the end of the for
loop (but still inside the loop), and after our downloading code has run
we will need to change the `startValue` variable, which is used in
building the URL of the page we want to download. If we forget to do
this, our program will repeatedly download the first search results page
since we are not actually changing anything in the initial URL. The
`startValue` variable, as discussed above, is what controls which search
results page we want to download. Therefore, we can request the next
search results page by increasing the value of `startValue` by 10 after
the initial download has completed. If you are not sure where to put
this line you can peek ahead to the finished code example below.

Finally, we want to ensure that the name of the file we have downloaded
is different for each file. Otherwise, each download will save over the
previous download, leaving us with only a single file of search results.
To solve this, we can adjust the contents of the `filename` variable to
include the value held in `startValue` so that each time we download a new
page, it gets a different name. Since `startValue` is an integer, we will
have to convert it to a string before we can add it to the filename
variable. Adjust the line in your program that pertains to the `filename`
variable to looks like this:

``` python
filename = 'search-result' + str(startValue)
```

You should now be able to add these new lines of code to your
getSearchResults function. Recall we have made the following additions:

-   Add entries as an additional function argument right after toMonth
-   Calculate the number of search results pages and add this
    immediately after the line that begins with startValue = 0 (before
    we build the URL and start downloading)
-   Follow this immediately with a for loop that will tell the program
    to run once for each search results page, and indent the rest of the
    code in the function so that it is inside the new loop.
-   The last line in the for loop should now increase the value of the
    startValue variable each time the loop runs.
-   Adjust the existing filename variable so that each time a search
    results page is downloaded it gives the file a unique name.

The finished function code in your `obo.py` file should look like this:

``` python
#create URLs for search results pages and save the files
def getSearchResults(query, kwparse, fromYear, fromMonth, toYear, toMonth, entries):

    import urllib.request, math

    startValue = 0

    #this is new! Determine how many files need to be downloaded.
    pageCount = entries / 10
    pageCount = math.ceil(pageCount)

    #this line is new!
    for pages in range(1, pageCount +1):

        #each part of the URL. Split up to be easier to read.
        url = 'https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?gen=1&form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext='
        url += query
        url += '&kwparse=' + kwparse
        url += '&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount'
        url += '&fromYear=' + fromYear
        url += '&fromMonth=' + fromMonth
        url += '&toYear=' + toYear
        url += '&toMonth=' + toMonth
        url += '&start=' + str(startValue)
        url += '&count=0'

        #download the page and save the result.
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        webContent = response.read()
        filename = 'search-result' + str(startValue)
        f = open(filename + ".html", 'wb')
        f.write(webContent)
        f.close

        #this lines is new!
        startValue = startValue + 10
```

To run this new function, add the extra argument to
`download-searches.py` and run the program again:

``` python
#download-searches.py
import obo

query = 'mulatto*+negro*'

obo.getSearchResults(query, "advanced", "1700", "00", "1750", "99", 13)
```

Great! Now we have both search results pages, called
`search-result0.html` and `search-result10.html`. But before we move
onto the next step in the algorithm, let’s take care of some
housekeeping. Our `programming-historian` directory will quickly become
unwieldy if we download multiple search results pages and trial
transcripts. Let’s have Python make a new directory named after our
search terms.

We want to add this new functionality in `getSearchResults`, so that our
search results pages are downloaded to a directory with the same name as
our search query. This will keep our `programming-historian` directory
more organized. To do this we will create a new directory using the `os`
library, short for “operating system”. That library contains a function
called `makedirs`, which, unsurprisingly, makes a new directory. You can
try this out using the Terminal.

``` python
import os

query = "myNewDirectory"
if not os.path.exists(query):
    os.makedirs(query)
```

This program will check to see if your computer already has a directory
with this name. If not, you should now have a directory called
`myNewDirectory` on your computer. On a Mac this is probably located in
your `/Users/username/` directory, and on Windows you should be able to
find it in the `Python` directory on your computer, the same in which
you opened your command line program. If this worked you can delete the
directory from your hard drive, since it was just for practice. Since we
want to create a new directory named after the query that we input into
the Old Bailey Online website, we will make direct use of the query
function argument from the getSearchResults function. To do this, import
the `os` library after the others and then add the
code you have just written immediately below. Your `getSearchResults`
function should now look like this:

``` python
#create URLs for search results pages and save the files
def getSearchResults(query, kwparse, fromYear, fromMonth, toYear, toMonth, entries):

    import urllib.request, math, os

    #This line is new! Create a new directory
    if not os.path.exists(query):
        os.makedirs(query)

    startValue = 0

    #Determine how many files need to be downloaded.
    pageCount = entries / 10
    pageCount = math.ceil(pageCount)

    for pages in range(1, pageCount +1):

        #each part of the URL. Split up to be easier to read.
        url = 'https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?gen=1&form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext='
        url += query
        url += '&kwparse=' + kwparse
        url += '&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount'
        url += '&fromYear=' + fromYear
        url += '&fromMonth=' + fromMonth
        url += '&toYear=' + toYear
        url += '&toMonth=' + toMonth
        url += '&start=' + str(startValue)
        url += '&count=0'

        #download the page and save the result.
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        webContent = response.read()

        #save the result to the new directory
        filename = 'search-result' + str(startValue)

        f = open(filename + ".html", 'wb')
        f.write(webContent)
        f.close

        startValue = startValue + 10
```

The last step for this function is to make sure that when we save our
search results pages, we save them in this new directory. To do this we
can make a minor adjustment to the filename variable so that the file
ends up in the right place. There are many ways we can do this, the
easiest of which is just to append the new directory name plus a slash
to the name of the file:

``` python
filename = query + '/' + 'search-result' + str(startValue)
```

If your computer is running Windows you will need to use a backslash
instead of a forward slash in the above example. Add the above line to
your `getSearchResults` page in lieu of the current `filename` description.

If you are running Windows, chances are your `downloadSearches.py`
program will now crash when you run it because you are trying to create
a directory with a \* in it. Windows does not like this. To get around
this problem we can use [regular expressions][] to remove any
non-Windows-friendly characters. We used regular expressions previously
in [Counting Frequencies][]. To remove non-alpha-numeric characters from
the query, first import the regular expressions library immediately
after you have imported the `os` library, then use the `re.sub()` function
to create a new string named `cleanQuery` that contains only alphanumeric
characters. You will then have to substitute `cleanQuery` as the variable
used in the `os.path.exists()`, `os.makedirs()`, and `filename` declarations.

``` python
import urllib.request, math, os, re
cleanQuery = re.sub(r'\W+', '', query)
if not os.path.exists(cleanQuery):
    os.makedirs(cleanQuery)

...

filename = cleanQuery + '/' + 'search-result' + str(startValue)
```

The final version of your function should look like this:

``` python
#create URLs for search results pages and save the files
def getSearchResults(query, kwparse, fromYear, fromMonth, toYear, toMonth, entries):

    import urllib.request, math, os, re

    cleanQuery = re.sub(r'\W+', '', query)
    if not os.path.exists(cleanQuery):
        os.makedirs(cleanQuery)

    startValue = 0

    # Determine how many files need to be downloaded.
    pageCount = entries / 10
    pageCount = math.ceil(pageCount)

    for pages in range(1, pageCount +1):

        #each part of the URL. Split up to be easier to read.
        url = 'https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?gen=1&form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext='
        url += query
        url += '&kwparse=' + kwparse
        url += '&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount'
        url += '&fromYear=' + fromYear
        url += '&fromMonth=' + fromMonth
        url += '&toYear=' + toYear
        url += '&toMonth=' + toMonth
        url += '&start=' + str(startValue)
        url += '&count=0'

        #download the page and save the result.
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        webContent = response.read()
        filename = cleanQuery + '/' + 'search-result' + str(startValue)
        f = open(filename + ".html", 'wb')
        f.write(webContent)
        f.close

        startValue = startValue + 10
```

This time we tell the program to download the trials and put them in the
new directory rather than our `programming-historian` directory. Run
`download-searches.py` once more to ensure this worked and you
understand how to save files to a particular directory using Python.

### Downloading the individual trial entries

At this stage we have created a function that can download all of the
search results HTML files from the Old Bailey Online website for an
advanced search that we have defined, and have done so programmatically.
Now for the next step in the algorithm: Extract the URLs of each trial
transcript from the search results HTML files. In the lessons that
precede this one (eg, [Working with Webpages][]), we have worked with the printer friendly versions of
the trial transcripts, so we will continue to do so. We know that the
printer friendly version of Benjamin Bowsey’s trial is located at the
URL:

```
http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/print.jsp?div=t17800628-33
```

In the same way that changing query strings in the URLs yields different
search results, changing the URL for trial records – namely substituting
one trial ID for another – we will get the transcript for that new
trial. This means that to find and download the 13 matching files, all
we need are these trial IDs. Since we know that search results pages on
websites generally contain a link to the pages described, there is a
good chance that we can find these links embedded in the HTML code. If
we can scrape this information from the downloaded search results pages,
we can then use that information to generate a URL that will allow us to
download each trial transcript. This is a technique that you can use for
most search result pages, not just Old Bailey Online! To do this, we
must first find where the trial IDs are amidst the HTML code in the
downloaded files, and then determine a way to consistently isolate them
using code so that no matter which search results page we download from
the site we are able to find the trial transcripts. First, open
`search-results0.html` in Komodo Edit and have a look for the list of
the trials. The first entry starts with “Anne Smith” so you can use the
“find” feature in Komodo Edit to jump immediately to the right spot.
Notice Anne’s name is part of a link:

```
browse.jsp?id=t17160113-18&amp;div=t17160113-18&amp;terms=mulatto*_negro*#highlight
```

Perfect, the link contains the trial ID! Scroll through the remaining
entries and you’ll find the same is true. Lucky for us, the site is well
formatted and it looks like each link starts with “browse.jsp?id=”
followed by the trial ID and finished with an &, in Anne’s case:
“browse.jsp?id=t17160113-18&”. We can write a few lines of code that can
isolate those IDs. Take a look at the following function. This function
also uses the `os` library, in this case to list all of the files
located in the directory created in the previous section. The `os`
library contains a range of useful functions that mirror the types of
tasks you would expect to be able to do with your mouse in the Mac
Finder or Windows such as opening, closing, creating, deleting, and
moving files and directories, and is a great library to master – or at
least familiarize yourself with.

``` python
def getIndivTrials(query):
    import os, re

    cleanQuery = re.sub(r'\W+', '', query)
    searchResults = os.listdir(cleanQuery)

    print(searchResults)
```

Create and run a new program called `extract-trial-ids.py` with the
following code. Make sure you input the same value into the query
argument as you did in the previous example:

``` python
import obo

obo.getIndivTrials("mulatto*+negro*")
```

If everything went right, you should see a list containing the names of
all the files in your new “mulatto\*+negro\*” directory, which at this
point should be the two search results pages. Ensure this worked before
moving forward. Since we saved all of the search results pages with a
filename that includes “search-results”, we now want to open each file
with a name containing “search-results”, and extract all trial IDs found
therein. In this case we know we have 2, but we want our code to be as
reusable as possible (with reason, of course!) Restricting this action
to files named “search-results” will mean that this program will work as
intended even if the directory contains many other unrelated files
because the program will skip over anything with a different name. Add
the following to your getIndivTrials() function, which will check if
each file contains “search-results” in its name. If it does, the file
will be opened and the contents saved to a variable named text. That
text variable will then be parsed looking for the trial ID, which we
know always follows “browse.jsp?id=”. If and when that trial ID is found
it will be saved to a list and printed to the command output, which
leaves us with all of the information we need to then write a program
that will download the desired trials.

``` python
def getIndivTrials(query):
    import os, re

    cleanQuery = re.sub(r'\W+', '', query)
    searchResults = os.listdir(cleanQuery)

    urls = []

    #find search-results pages
    for files in searchResults:
        if files.find("search-result") != -1:
            f = open(cleanQuery + "/" + files, 'r')
            text = f.read().split(" ")
            f.close()

            #look for trial IDs
            for words in text:
                if words.find("browse.jsp?id=") != -1:
                    #isolate the id
                    urls.append(words[words.find("id=") +3: words.find("&")])

    print(urls)
```

That last line of the for loop may look tricky, but make sure you
understand it before moving on. The words variable is checked to see if
it contains the characters “id=” (without the quotes), which of course
refers to a specific trial transcript ID. If it does, we use the slice
string method to capture only the chunk between *id=* and *&* and append it
to the url list. If we knew the exact index positions of this substring
we could have used those numerical values instead. However, by using the
*find()* string method we have created a much more flexible program. The
following code does exactly the same thing as that last line in a less
condensed manner.

``` python
idStart = words.find("id=") + 3
idEnd = words.find("&")
trialID = words[idStart: idEnd]

urls.append(trialID)
```

When you re-run `extract-trial-ids.py`, you should now see a list of all
the trial IDs. We can add a couple extra lines to turn these into proper
URLs and download the whole list to our new directory. We’ll also use
the `time` library to pause our program for three seconds between
downloads– a technique called throttling. It’s considered good form not
to pound someone’s server with many requests per second; and the slight
delay makes it more likely that all the files will actually download
rather than [time out][]. Add the following code to the end of your
`getIndivTrials()` function. This code will generate the URL of each
individual page, download the page to your computer, place it in your
new directory, save the file, and pause for 3 seconds before moving on
to the next trial. This work is all contained in a for loop, and will
run once for every trial in your url list.

``` python
def getIndivTrials(query):
    #...
    import urllib.request, time

    #import built-in python functions for building file paths
    from os.path import join as pjoin

    for items in urls:
        #generate the URL
        url = "http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/print.jsp?div=" + items

        #download the page
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        webContent = response.read()

        #create the filename and place it in the new directory
        filename = items + '.html'
        filePath = pjoin(cleanQuery, filename)

        #save the file
        f = open(filePath, 'wb')
        f.write(webContent)
        f.close

        #pause for 3 second
        time.sleep(3)
```

If we put this all together into a single function it should look
something like this. (Note, we’ve put all the “import” calls at the top
to keep things cleaner).

``` python
def getIndivTrials(query):
    import os, re, urllib.request, time

    #import built-in python functions for building file paths
    from os.path import join as pjoin

    cleanQuery = re.sub(r'\W+', '', query)
    searchResults = os.listdir(cleanQuery)

    urls = []

    #find search-results pages
    for files in searchResults:
        if files.find("search-result") != -1:
            f = open(cleanQuery + "/" + files, 'r')
            text = f.read().split(" ")
            f.close()

            #look for trial IDs
            for words in text:
                if words.find("browse.jsp?id=") != -1:
                    #isolate the id
                    urls.append(words[words.find("id=") +3: words.find("&")])

    #new from here down!
    for items in urls:
        #generate the URL
        url = "http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/print.jsp?div=" + items

        #download the page
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        webContent = response.read()

        #create the filename and place it in the new directory
        filename = items + '.html'
        filePath = pjoin(cleanQuery, filename)

        #save the file
        f = open(filePath, 'wb')
        f.write(webContent)
        f.close

        #pause for 3 seconds
        time.sleep(3)
```

Let’s add the same three-second pause to our `getSearchResults` function
to be kind to the Old Bailey Online servers:

``` python
#create URLs for search results pages and save the files
def getSearchResults(query, kwparse, fromYear, fromMonth, toYear, toMonth, entries):

    import urllib.request, math, os, re, time

    cleanQuery = re.sub(r'\W+', '', query)
    if not os.path.exists(cleanQuery):
        os.makedirs(cleanQuery)

    startValue = 0

    #Determine how many files need to be downloaded.
    pageCount = entries / 10
    pageCount = math.ceil(pageCount)

    for pages in range(1, pageCount +1):

        #each part of the URL. Split up to be easier to read.
        url = 'https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?gen=1&form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext='
        url += query
        url += '&kwparse=' + kwparse
        url += '&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount'
        url += '&fromYear=' + fromYear
        url += '&fromMonth=' + fromMonth
        url += '&toYear=' + toYear
        url += '&toMonth=' + toMonth
        url += '&start=' + str(startValue)
        url += '&count=0'

        #download the page and save the result.
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        webContent = response.read()
        filename = cleanQuery + '/' + 'search-result' + str(startValue)
        f = open(filename + ".html", 'wb')
        f.write(webContent)
        f.close

        startValue = startValue + 10

        #pause for 3 seconds
        time.sleep(3)
```

Finally, call the function in the `download-searches.py` program.

``` python
#download-searches.py
import obo

query = 'mulatto*+negro*'

obo.getSearchResults(query, "advanced", "1700", "00", "1750", "99", 13)

obo.getIndivTrials(query)
```

Now, you’ve created a program that can request and download files from
the Old Bailey website based on search parameters you define, all
without visiting the site!

### In case a file does not download

Check to make all thirteen files have downloaded properly. If that’s the
case for you, that’s great! However, there’s a possibility that this
program stalled along the way. That’s because our program, though
running on your own machine, relies on two factors outside of our
immediate control: the speed of the Internet, and the response time of
the Old Bailey Online server at that moment. It’s one thing to ask
Python to download a single file, but when we start asking for a file
every 3 seconds there’s a greater chance the server will either time out
or fail to send us the file we are after.

If we were using a web browser to make these requests, we’d eventually
get a message that the “connection had timed out” or something of the
sort. We all see this from time to time. However, our program isn’t
built to handle or relay such error messages, so instead you’ll realize
it when you discover that the program has not returned the expected
number of files or just seemingly does nothing. To prevent frustration
and uncertainty, we want a fail-safe in our program that will attempt to
download each trial. If for whatever reason it fails, we’ll make a note
of it and move on to the next trial.

To do this, we will make use of the Python [try / except][] error
handling mechanism, as well as a new library: socket. Try and Except are
a lot like an *if / else* statement. When you ask Python to *try* something,
it will attempt to run the code; if the code fails to achieve what you
have defined, it will run the *except* code. This is often used when
dealing with errors, known as *error handling*. We can use this to our
advantage by telling our program to attempt downloading a page. If it
fails, we’ll ask it to let us know which file failed and then move on.
To do this we need to use the `socket` library, which will allow us to put
a time limit on a download attempt before moving on. This involves
altering the `getIndivTrials` function.

First, we need to load the `socket` library, which should be done in the
same way as all of our previous library imports. Then, we need to import
the `urllib.error` library, which allows us to handle download errors.
We will also need to
set the default socket timeout length – how long do we want to try to
download a page before we give up. This should go immediately after the
comment that begins with `#download the page`

``` python
    import os, re, urllib.request, urllib.error, time, socket

    #...
        #download the page
        socket.setdefaulttimeout(10)
```

Then, we need a new python list that will hold all of the urls that
failed to download. We will call this `failedAttempts` and you can insert
it immediately after the `import` instructions:

``` python
failedAttempts = []
```

Finally, we can add the *try / except* statement, which is added in much
the same way as an *if / else* statement would be. In this case, we will
put all of the code designed to download and save the trials in the try
statement, and in the except statement we will tell the program what we
want it to do if that should fail. Here, we will append the url that
failed to download to our new list, `failedAttempts`

``` python
#...

        socket.setdefaulttimeout(10)

        try:
            response = urllib2.urlopen(url)
            webContent = response.read()

            #create the filename and place it in the new "trials" directory
            filename = items + '.html'
            filePath = pjoin(newDir, filename)

            #save the file
            f = open(filePath, 'w')
            f.write(webContent)
            f.close
        except urllib.error.URLError:
            failedAttempts.append(url)
```

Finally, we will tell the program to print the contents of the list to
the command output so we know which files failed to download. This
should be added as the last line in the function.

``` python
print("failed to download: " + str(failedAttempts))
```

Now when you run the program, should there be a problem downloading a
particular file, you will receive a message in the Command Output window
of Komodo Edit. This message will contain any URLs of files that failed
to download. If there are only one or two, it’s probably fastest just to
visit the pages manually and use the “Save As” feature of your browser.
If you are feeling adventurous, you could modify the program to
automatically download the remaining files. The final version of your
`getSearchResults()` and `getIndivTrials()` functions should now
look like this:

``` python
#create URLs for search results pages and save the files
def getSearchResults(query, kwparse, fromYear, fromMonth, toYear, toMonth, entries):

    import urllib.request, math, os, re, time

    cleanQuery = re.sub(r'\W+', '', query)
    if not os.path.exists(cleanQuery):
        os.makedirs(cleanQuery)

    startValue = 0

    #Determine how many files need to be downloaded.
    pageCount = entries / 10
    pageCount = math.ceil(pageCount)

    for pages in range(1, pageCount +1):

        #each part of the URL. Split up to be easier to read.
        url = 'https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?gen=1&form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext='
        url += query
        url += '&kwparse=' + kwparse
        url += '&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=sessionsPaper_trialAccount'
        url += '&fromYear=' + fromYear
        url += '&fromMonth=' + fromMonth
        url += '&toYear=' + toYear
        url += '&toMonth=' + toMonth
        url += '&start=' + str(startValue)
        url += '&count=0'

        #download the page and save the result.
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        webContent = response.read()
        filename = cleanQuery + '/' + 'search-result' + str(startValue)
        f = open(filename + ".html", 'wb')
        f.write(webContent)
        f.close

        startValue = startValue + 10

        #pause for 3 seconds
        time.sleep(3)

def getIndivTrials(query):
    import os, re, urllib.request, urllib.error, time, socket

    failedAttempts = []

    #import built-in python functions for building file paths
    from os.path import join as pjoin

    cleanQuery = re.sub(r'\W+', '', query)
    searchResults = os.listdir(cleanQuery)

    urls = []

    #find search-results pages
    for files in searchResults:
        if files.find("search-result") != -1:
            f = open(cleanQuery + "/" + files, 'r')
            text = f.read().split(" ")
            f.close()

            #look for trial IDs
            for words in text:
                if words.find("browse.jsp?id=") != -1:
                    #isolate the id
                    urls.append(words[words.find("id=") +3: words.find("&")])

    for items in urls:
        #generate the URL
        url = "http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/print.jsp?div=" + items

        #download the page
        socket.setdefaulttimeout(10)
        try:
            response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
            webContent = response.read()

            #create the filename and place it in the new directory
            filename = items + '.html'
            filePath = pjoin(cleanQuery, filename)

            #save the file
            f = open(filePath, 'wb')
            f.write(webContent)
            f.close
        except urllib.error.URLError:
            failedAttempts.append(url)

        #pause for 3 seconds
        time.sleep(3)

    print("failed to download: " + str(failedAttempts))
```

## Further Reading

For more advanced users, or to become a more advanced user, you may find
it worthwhile to read about achieving this same process using
Application Programming Interfaces (API). A website with an API will
generally provide instructions on how to request certain documents. It’s
a very similar process to what we just did by interpreting the URL Query
Strings, but without the added detective work required to decipher what
each variable does. If you are interested in the Old Bailey Online, they
have recently released an API and the documentation can be quite
helpful:
