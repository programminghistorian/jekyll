He also teaches history and digital humanities at the [Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://people.epfl.ch/303254). He is a member of the board of Humanistica, the French-speaking association for Digital Humanities, and the Steering Committee  of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO). His main research domain is network analysis in history with a focus on intellectual history and history of international organizations. His recent publications range from the [analysis of the digital humanities community on Twitter](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01517493/document) to the study of specific [historical networks](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/complex-structures-and-international-organizations/) and theoretical contributions on [the use of network analysis in history](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-02179024/document).
