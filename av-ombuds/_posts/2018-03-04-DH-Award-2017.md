For the [second year in a row](/posts/dh-award-2016), our team is proud to report that the project has won a [Digital Humanities award](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2017/results/).

This time, the award recognised the hard work of our Spanish Team in creating a translation of the project, and building a Spanish-language community of scholars interested in digital methods.

These awards are community-driven, and we'd like to thank everyone who voted for our project, as well as to congratulate everyone who was nominated and who won in other categories. We were particularly excited to see other Spanish-language winners, which we view as a great boost for digital humanities internationalisation.

Congratulations especially to our Spanish team members:

Maria José Afanador-Llach, Víctor Gayol, Jennifer Isasi, José Antonio Motilla, and Antonio Rojas Castro. This is very well-earned recognition from the community.
