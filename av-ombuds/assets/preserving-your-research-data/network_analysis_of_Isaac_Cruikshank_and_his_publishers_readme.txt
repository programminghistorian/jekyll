These three folders represent my efforts to apply network analysis to the Isaac Cruikshank corpus between September and December 2012 (research funded by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art).

Each folder represents datasets for publishers of prints etched and/or engraved by Isaac Cruikshank.
Within each folder is contained a list of images (...image_list.csv), one or more Gephi project (..._Gephi.gephi) and the edges (..._network_edges.csv) and nodes (..._network_nodes.csv) used as the data within the Gephi projects. For the Samuel_Fores folder there are also .gephi and .csv files for four seperate time periods and various image files.


Each ...image_list.csv includes the following fields:
A Printseller		Left blank
B Address		Left blank
C Year			Year of print publication
D Date			Date of print publication (if only the year is known only the year is entered)
E Title of Print	If square brackets are used, name is print is u
F S1			A specific Location depicted within the print
G S2			A specific Location depicted within the print
H S3			A specific Location depicted within the print
I G1			A generic Location depicted within the print
J G2			A generic Location depicted within the print
K G3			A generic Location depicted within the print
L Indoors or Outdoors	Whether the scene depicted with in the print occurs indoors (In), outdoors (Out), in both location (Both) or none at all (blank)
M Ref			A reference number (the most common is BM which refers to the British Museum Catalogue of Satires)
N URL			A url
O Duplicates		Whether duplicates of the print exist within existing online image repositories.
Note: columns F-L and O are not derived from existing databases and are interpretive judgements made by me.

The data is drawn from data pertaining work produced by Isaac Cruikshank in The British Museum Prints and Drawings Catalogue, Edward J. Nygren, ed. Isaac Cruikshank and the Politics of Parody: Watercolors in the Huntington Collection (University of California Press, 2005), and the Library of Congress. I do not claim that these resources are complete or comprehensive.
