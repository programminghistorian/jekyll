# Contribute to the Programming Historian

The _Programming Historian_ runs on the energy of volunteers, and we welcome contributions from the community. Most people become involved in one of the following activities:

- <a href="#readers">Readers: Report a problem with a lesson</a>
- <a href="#reviewers">Reviewers: Join our team of reviewers</a>
- <a href="#authors">Authors: Write a lesson</a>

We would much rather hear about a problem with a lesson than for you to leave frustrated if something doesn't work. As URLs change and as new versions of software and platforms are released, lessons develop glitches over time. Please help us keep the _Programming Historian_ up to date by letting us know about these when you come across them in the course of your reading. 

If you notice a problem with a lesson, please report it following our instructions on [how to create an issue in our GitHub repository](report-issue). Reporting only takes a moment and helps us provide the best learning resources possible.

Academic peer review is essential for producing trusted high-quality resources. The _Programming Historian_, holds peer review in the highest regard, and we take an open and collaborative approach in which reviewers get full and public credit for their work. For more on our review philosophy and procedures, please see the [Guidelines for Reviewers][reviewers].

We hope you'll consider joining our team of reviewers. The time commitment is flexible, and you'll be contributing to helping us maintain high academic standards for this community resource. Please email <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a> to introduce yourself and let us know about the specific skills, tools, topics, and technologies that you'd like to be involved with so that we can send you the most appropriate lessons to review.

From our own experience, we know that the difficult job of writing technically challenging but accessible tutorials is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills and actively engage in the digital humanities community.

We don't simply accept or reject articles like traditional journals. Our editors collaborate with you to help craft and hone your topic and approach, as well as to make your tutorial as clear and as useful as possible. Our peer review process helps improve your lessons even further, as well as improve your technical writing skills. Please read more about our [submission proceess][submissions].

If you'd like to propose a lesson (for you or for someone else to write), email <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a>.

No matter how you'd like to be involved, you can always email <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a> with any comments, questions, complaints, or suggestions.  We endeavor to respond to all emails promptly.
