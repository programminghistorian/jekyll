# Contribute to The Programming Historian

_Programming Historian_ runs on the far-from-endless energy of volunteers, and we want to hear from anyone who shares our interest in teaching digital methods, forging new processes of peer review, and building diversity in the digital humanities community. Below we've outlined a common ways to contribute; please let us know any ideas you have for broadening participation.

## Write a new lesson

Writing a tutorial is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills and actively engage in the digital humanities community.

We don't simply accept or reject articles like traditional journals. Our editors collaborate with you to help craft your essay to be as clear and as useful as possible--a great way to improve your technical writing skills. Please read more about our [submission process][submissions].

If you'd like to propose a lesson (for you or for someone else to write), email <a href="mailto:jeri.elizabeth%2Bproghist@gmail.com">Jeri Wieringa</a>.

## Join our team of reviewers

_Programming Historian_ holds peer review in the highest regard, and we take an open and collaborative approach in which reviewers get full and public credit for their work. For more on our review philosophy and procedures, please see the [Guidelines for Reviewers][reviewers].

We hope you'll consider joining our team of reviewers. The time commitment is flexible, you'll learn a lot, and contribute to a widely-used and highly-valued resource. Please email <a href="mailto:jeri.elizabeth%2Bproghist@gmail.com">Jeri Wieringa</a> to introduce yourself and let us know any specific skills, tools, topics, and technologies that you'd like to focus on.


## Edit lessons

Our editorial board members help facilitate peer review and work with authors closely to make improvements to their lessons. Our [guidelines for editors](editor-guidelines) is meant to ensure that everyone, from authors to reviewers to members of the wider community, receive a fair and consistent experience during peer review.

From time to time we may advertise that we are seeking more editors.

## Provide feedback or report problems

We welcome [feedback](feedback.html) on any aspect of the Programming Historian. Let us know what we can do to make the project better!

We are especially grateful for tips about lessons that seem to be broken. As URLs change and as new versions of software and platforms are released, lessons develop glitches over time. Please help us keep the _Programming Historian_ up to date by letting us know about these when you come across them in the course of your reading.
