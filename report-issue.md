See a problem with a lesson on the Programming Historian? Code that doesn't work or needs a clearer explanation? Typos? Syntax that doesn't look quite right? Thank you for taking the time to report a problem. Your assistance is crucial for helping us maintain the highest standards for our lessons.

There are three easy ways that you can provide your feedback:

<br/>

## Option 1: Open an Issue on GitHub

First, [sign up for a free, personal GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) if you don't already have one. Log in if you already have an account.

Then, go to the [issues page](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues?state=open) for our Repository. 

Glance at the open issues to see if the problem you have identified has already been reported. If it has, but you have additional information to share, leave a comment on that issue.

If your issue has not been reported, create a new issue with a descriptive title and as much information about the problem as you can give.

For more information about issues, read the GitHub Guide on [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

## Option 2: Make a Pull Request

If you believe you know how to fix the problem in the lesson, you may wish to consider forking our repository and making a pull request.

For more information on pull requests, see the GitHub Guide on [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) or Rich Jones's tutorial on [How to GitHub](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/).

## Option 3: Send Us an Email

If you are unable to create an issue or make a pull request, you can also contact <a href="mailto:fwgibbs@gmail.com">Fred Gibbs</a> at the University of New Mexico.

## Further Resources on Git and GitHub

Using Git and GitHub can be fairly simple once you get the hang of it.  If you are interested in learning more and contributing, the [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) website is a great place to start.
