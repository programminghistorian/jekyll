Lesson Goals
------------

Welcome to your first Lesson. All of our lessons branch off from this
core set of instructions, which are designed to get you ready to start
programming. In this lesson you will learn where to turn when you need
help should you get stuck.

These lessons introduce the Python scripting language, describe how to
install Python, and demonstrate a basic program that creates and views
HTML files.
