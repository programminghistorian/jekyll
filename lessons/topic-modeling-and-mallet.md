Editor's Note
-------------

This lesson requires you to use the command line. If you have no
previous experience using the command line you may find it helpful to
work through the Programming Historian [Bash Command Line][] lesson.

**As noted below, while there is currently a preview release of MALLET 2.0.8 available, this
lesson uses the official release of MALLET 2.0.7. If you are following
along with our instructions, please be sure to download the correct version.**

Lesson Goals
------------

In this lesson you will first learn what *topic modeling* is and why you
might want to employ it in your research. You will then learn how to
install and work with the MALLET *natural language processing* toolkit
to do so. MALLET involves modifying an *environment variable*
(essentially, setting up a short-cut so that your computer always knows
where to find the MALLET program) and working with the *command line*
(ie, by typing in commands manually, rather than clicking on icons or
menus). We will run the topic modeller on some example files, and look
at the kinds of outputs that MALLET installed. This will give us a
good idea of how it can be used on a corpus of texts to identify topics
found in the documents without reading them individually.

Please see the MALLET users' [discussion list][] for the full range of
things one can do with the software.

(We would like to thank Robert Nelson and Elijah Meeks for hints and
tips in getting MALLET to run for us the first time, and for their
examples of what can be done with this tool.)

What is Topic Modeling And For Whom is this Useful?
---------------------------------------------------

A *topic modeling* tool takes a single text (or corpus) and looks for
patterns in the use of words; it is an attempt to inject semantic
meaning into vocabulary. Before you begin with topic modeling, you
should ask yourself whether or not it is likely to be useful for your
project. Matthew Kirschenbaum's *[Distant Reading][]* (a talk given at the
2009 National Science Foundation Symposium on the Next Generation of
Data Mining and Cyber-Enabled Discovery for Innovation) and Stephen
Ramsay's *[Reading Machines][]* are good places for beginning to
understand in which circumstances a technique such as this could be most
effective. As with all tools, just because you can use it, doesn't
necessarily mean that you should. If you are working with a small number
of documents (or even a single document) it may well be that simple
frequency counts are sufficient, in which case something like [Voyant
Tools][] might be appropriate. However, if you have hundreds of
documents from an archive and you wish to understand something of what
the archive contains without necessarily reading every document, then
topic modeling might be a good approach.

Topic models represent a family of computer programs that extract
*topics* from *texts*. A topic to the computer is a list of words that
occur in statistically meaningful ways. A text can be an email, a blog
post, a book chapter, a journal article, a diary entry – that is, any
kind of unstructured text. By unstructured we mean that there are no
computer-readable annotations that tell the computer the semantic
meaning of the words in the text.

Topic modeling programs do not know anything about the meaning of the
words in a text. Instead, they assume that any piece of text is composed
(by an author) by selecting words from possible baskets of words where
each basket corresponds to a topic. If that is true, then it becomes
possible to mathematically decompose a text into the probable baskets
from whence the words first came. The tool goes through this process
over and over again until it settles on the most likely distribution of
words into baskets, which we call topics.

There are many different topic modeling programs available; this
tutorial uses one called MALLET. If one used it on a series of
political speeches for example, the program would return a list of
topics and the keywords composing those topics. Each of these lists is a
topic according to the algorithm. Using the example of political
speeches, the list might look like:

1.  Job Jobs Loss Unemployment Growth
2.  Economy Sector Economics Stock Banks
3.  Afghanistan War Troops Middle-East Taliban Terror
4.  Election Opponent Upcoming President
5.  *et cetera*

By examining the keywords we can discern that the politician who gave
the speeches was concerned with the economy, jobs, the Middle East, the
upcoming election, and so on.

As Scott Weingart warns, there are many [dangers][] that face those who
use topic modeling without fully understanding it. For instance, we
might be interested in word use as a proxy for placement along a
political spectrum. Topic modeling could certainly help with that, but
we have to remember that the proxy is not in itself the thing we seek to
understand – as Andrew Gelman demonstrates in his mock study of [zombies
using Google Trends][]. Ted Underwood and Lisa Rhody (see Further
Reading) argue that we as historians would be better to think of these
categories as discourses; however for our purposes here we will continue
to use the word: topic.

Note: You will sometimes come across the term "*LDA*" when looking into
the bibliography of topic modeling. LDA and Topic Model are often used
synonymously, but the LDA technique is actually a special case of topic
modeling created by [David Blei and friends][] in 2002. It was not the
first technique now considered topic modeling, but it is by far the most
popular. The myriad variations of topic modeling have resulted in an
alphabet soup of techniques and programs to implement them that might be
confusing or overwhelming to the uninitiated; ignore them for now. They
all work in much the same way. MALLET uses LDA.

### Examples of topic models employed by historians:

-   Rob Nelson, *[Mining the Dispatch][]*
-   Cameron Blevins, "[Topic Modeling Martha Ballard's Diary][]"
    *Historying*, April 1, 2010.
-   David J Newman and Sharon Block, "Probabilistic topic decomposition
    of an eighteenth century American newspaper," *Journal of the
    American Society for Information Science and Technology* vol. 57,
    no. 6 (April 1, 2006): 753-767.

Installing MALLET
-------------------

There are many tools one could use to create topic models, but at the
time of this writing (summer 2012) the simplest tool to run your text
through is called MALLET. [MALLET][] uses an implementation of
[*Gibbs sampling*][], a statistical technique meant to quickly construct
a sample distribution, to create its topic models. MALLET requires
using the command line – we'll talk about that more in a moment,
although you typically use the same few commands over and over.

**While there is currently a preview release of MALLET 2.0.8 available, this
lesson uses the official release of MALLET 2.0.7. If you are following
along with our instructions, please be sure to download the correct version.**

The installation instructions are different for Windows and Mac. Follow
the instructions appropriate for you below:

{% include figure.html filename="windows-150x150.png" caption="" %}

### Windows Instructions

1.  Go to the [MALLET][] project page, and [`download MALLET`][]. (As
    of this writing, remember, we are working with version 2.0.7.)
2.  You will also need the [Java developer's kit][] – that is, not the
    regular Java that's on every computer, but the one that lets you
    program things. Install this on your computer.
3.  Unzip MALLET into your `C:` directory . This is important: it
    cannot be anywhere else. You will then have a directory called
    `C:\mallet-2.0.7` or similar. For simplicity's sake, rename this
    directory just `mallet`.
4.  MALLET uses an *environment variable* to tell the computer where to
    find all the various components of its processes when it is running.
    It's rather like a shortcut for the program. A programmer cannot
    know exactly where every user will install a program, so the
    programmer creates a variable in the code that will always stand in
    for that location. We tell the computer, once, where that location
    is by setting the environment variable. If you moved the program to
    a new location, you'd have to change the variable.

To create an environment variable in Windows 7, click on your
`Start Menu -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings`
(Figures 1,2,3). Click new and type `MALLET_HOME` in the variable name
box. It must be like this – all caps, with an underscore – since that is
the shortcut that the programmer built into the program and all of its
subroutines. Then type the exact path (location) of where you unzipped
MALLET in the variable value, e.g., `c:\mallet`.

To see if you have been successful, please read on to the next section.

{% include figure.html filename="fig1-advanced-system-settings.png" caption="Figure 1: Advanced System Settings on Windows" %}

{% include figure.html filename="fig2-environment-variables-location.png" caption="Figure 2: Environment Variables Location" %}

{% include figure.html filename="fig3-environment-variable.png" caption="Figure 3: Environment Variable" %}

#### Running MALLET using the Command Line

MALLET is run from the command line, also known as *Command Prompt*
(Figure 4). If you remember MS-DOS, or have ever played with a Unix
computer Terminal, this will be familiar. The command line is where you
can type commands directly, rather than clicking on icons and menus.

{% include figure.html filename="fig-4-command-prompt-window.png" caption="Figure 4: Command Prompt on Windows" %}

1.  Click on your
    `Start Menu -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt`.\
     You'll get the command prompt window, which will have a cursor at
    `c:\user\user>` (or similar; see Figure 4).
2.  Type `cd ..` (That is: cd-space-period-period) to *change
    directory*. Keep doing this until you're at the `C:\` . (as in
    Figure 5)

{% include figure.html filename="fig-5-command-prompt-window-getting-to-c.png" caption="Figure 5: Navigating to the C:\ Directory in Command Prompt" %}

1.  Then type `cd mallet `and you are in the MALLETdirectory. Anything
    you type in the command prompt window is a *command*. There are
    commands like `cd` (change directory) and `dir` (list directory
    contents) that the computer understands. You have to tell the
    computer explicitly that 'this is a MALLET command' when you want
    to use MALLET. You do this by telling the computer to grab its
    instructions from the MALLET *bin*, a subfolder in MALLET that
    contains the core operating routines.
2.  Type `bin\mallet` as in Figure 6. If all has gone well, you should
    be presented with a list of MALLET commands – congratulations! If
    you get an error message, check your typing. Did you use the wrong
    slash? Did you set up the environment variable correctly? Is
    MALLET located at `C:\mallet` ?

{% include figure.html filename="fig-6command-prompt-mallet-installed.png" caption="Figure 6: Command Prompt MALLET Installed" %}

You are now ready to skip ahead to the next section.

{% include figure.html filename="apple-150x150.png" caption="" %}

### Mac Instructions

Many of the instructions for OS X installation are similar to Windows,
with a few differences. In fact, it is a bit easier.

1.  Download and [install MALLET 2.0.7 (*mallet-2.0.7.tar.gaz*as of Summer
    2012).][`download MALLET`]
2.  Download the [Java Development Kit][Java developer's kit].

Unzip MALLET into a directory on your system (for ease of following
along with this tutorial, your `/user/` directory works but anywhere is
okay). Once it is unzipped, open up your Terminal window (in the
`Applications` directory in your Finder. Navigate to the directory where
you unzipped MALLET using the Terminal (it will be `mallet-2.0.7` . If
you unzipped it into your `/user/` directory as was suggested in this
lesson, you can navigate to the correct directory by typing
`cd mallet-2.0.7`). cd is short for "change directory" when working in
the Terminal.

The same command will suffice to run commands from this directory,
except you need to append `./` (period-slash) before each command. This
needs to be done before all MALLET commands when working on a Mac.

Going forward, the commands for MALLET on a Mac will be nearly
identical to those on Windows, except for the direction of slashes
(there are a few other minor differences that will be noted when they
arise). If on Windows a command would be `\bin\mallet`, on a Mac you
would instead type:

``` bash
./bin/mallet
```

A list of commands should appear. If it does, congratulations – you've
installed it correctly!

Typing in MALLET Commands
-------------------------

Now that you have MALLET installed, it is time to learn what commands
are available to use with the program. There are nine MALLET commands
you can use (see Figure 6 above). Sometimes you can combine multiple
instructions. At the Command Prompt or Terminal (depending on your
operating system), try typing:

``` bash
import-dir --help
```

You are presented with the error message that `import-dir` is not
recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or
batch file. This is because we forgot to tell the computer to look in
the MALLET `bin` for it. Try again, with

``` 
bin\mallet import-dir --help
```

Remember, the direction of the slash matters (See Figure 7, which
provides an entire transcript of what we have done so far in the
tutorial). We checked to see that we had installed MALLET by typing in
`bin\mallet`. We then made the mistake with `import-dir` a few lines
further down. After that, we successfully called up the help file, which
told us what `import-dir` does, and it listed all of the potential
*parameters* you can set for this tool.

{% include figure.html filename="fig-7-command-prompt-typing-help.png" caption="Figure 7: The Help Menu in MALLET" %}

Note: there is a difference in MALLET commands between a single hyphen
and a double hyphen. A single hyphen is simply part of the name; it
replaces a space (e.g., `import-dir` rather than import dir), since
spaces offset multiple commands or parameters. These parameters let us
tweak the file that is created when we import our texts into MALLET. A
double hyphen (as with `–help` above) modifies, adds a sub-command, or
specifies some sort of parameter to the command.

For Windows users, if you got the error *'exception in thread "main"
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:'* it might be because you installed
MALLET somewhere other than in the `C:\` directory. For instance,
installing MALLET at `C:\Program Files\mallet` will produce this error
message. The second thing to check is that your environment variable is
set correctly. In either of these cases, check the Windows installation
instructions and double check that you followed them properly.

Working with data
-----------------

MALLET comes pre-packaged with sample `.txt` files with which you can
practice. Type `dir` at the `C:\mallet> prompt`, and you are given the
listing of the MALLET directory contents. One of those directories is
called `sample-data`. You know it is a directory because it has the word
\<dir\> beside it.

Type `cd sample-data`. Type `dir` again. Using what you know, navigate
to first the `web` then the `en` directories. You can look inside these
`.txt` files by typing the full name of the file (with extension).

Note that you cannot now run any MALLET commands from this directory.
Try it:

``` 
bin\mallet import-dir --help
```

You get the error message. You will have to navigate back to the main
MALLET folder to run the commands. This is because of the way MALLET
and its components are structured.

Importing data
--------------

In the `sample data` directory, there are a number of `.txt` files. Each
one of these files is a single document, the text of a number of
different web pages. The entire folder can be considered to be a corpus
of data. To work with this corpus and find out what the topics are that
compose these individual documents, we need to transform them from
several individual text files into a single MALLET format file.
MALLET can import more than one file at a time. We can import the
entire directory of text files using the `import` command. The commands
below import the directory, turn it into a MALLET file, keep the
original texts in the order in which they were listed, and strip out the
*stop words* (words such as *and*, *the*, *but*, and *if* that occur in
such frequencies that they obstruct analysis) using the default English
`stop-words` dictionary. Try the following, which will use sample data.

``` 
bin\mallet import-dir --input sample-data\web\en --output tutorial.mallet --keep-sequence --remove-stopwords
```

If you type `dir` now (or `ls` for Mac), you will find a file called
`tutorial.mallet`. (If you get an error message, you can hit the cursor
up key on your keyboard to recall the last command you typed, and look
carefully for typos). This file now contains all of your data, in a
format that MALLET can work with.

Try running it again now with different data. For example, let's imagine we wanted to use the German sample data instead. We would use:

``` 
bin\mallet import-dir --input sample-data\web\de --output tutorial.mallet --keep-sequence --remove-stopwords
```

And then finally, you could use your own data. Change `sample-data\web\de` to a directory that contains your own research files. Good luck!

If you are unsure how directories work, we suggest the *Programming Historian* lesson ["Introduction to the Bash Command Line"](/lessons/intro-to-bash). 

### For Mac

Mac instructions are similar to those above for Windows, but keep in
mind that Unix file paths (which are used by Mac) are different: for
example, if the directory was in one's home directory, one would type

``` bash
./bin/mallet import-dir --input /users/username/database/ --output tutorial.mallet --keep-sequence --remove-stopwords
```

Issues with Big Data
--------------------

If you're working with extremely large file collections – or indeed,
very large files – you may run into issues with your *heap space*, your
computer's working memory. This issue will initially arise during the
import sequence, if it is relevant. By default, MALLET allows for 1GB
of memory to be used. If you run into the following error message,
you've run into your limit:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

If your system has more memory, you can try increasing the memory
allocated to your *Java virtual machine*. To do so, you need to edit the
code in the `mallet` file found in the `bin` subdirectory of your
MALLET folder. Using Komodo Edit, (See [Mac][],
[Windows][], [Linux][] for installation instructions), open the
`Mallet.bat` file (`C:\Mallet\bin\mallet.bat`) if you are using Windows,
or the `mallet` file (`~/Mallet/bin/mallet`) if you are using Linux or OS X.

Find the following line:

`MEMORY=1g`

You can then change the 1g value upwards – to 2g, 4g, or even higher
depending on your system's RAM, which you can find out by looking up the
machine's system information.

Save your changes. You should now be able to avoid the error. If not,
increase the value again.

Your first topic model
----------------------

At the command prompt in the MALLET directory, type:

``` 
bin\mallet train-topics  --input tutorial.mallet
```

This command opens your `tutorial.mallet` file, and runs the topic model
routine on it using only the default settings. As it iterates through
the routine, trying to find the best division of words into topics, your
command prompt window will fill with output from each run. When it is
done, you can scroll up to see what it was outputting (as in Figure 8).

{% include figure.html filename="fig-8-basic-topic-model-output.png" caption="Figure 8: Basic Topic Model Output" %}

The computer is printing out the key words, the words that help define a
statistically significant topic, per the routine. In Figure 8, the first
topic it prints out might look like this (your key words might look a
bit different):

``` 
0    5    test cricket Australian hill acting England northern leading ended innings record runs scored run team batsman played society English
```

If you are a fan of cricket, you will recognize that all of these words
could be used to describe a cricket match. What we are dealing with here
is a topic related to Australian cricket. If you go to
`C:\mallet\sample-data\web\en\hill.txt`, you will see that this file is
a brief biography of the noted Australian cricketer Clem Hill. The 0 and
the 5 we will talk about later in the lesson. Note that MALLET
includes an element of randomness, so the keyword lists will look
different every time the program is run, even if on the same set of
data.

Go back to the main MALLET directory, and type `dir`. You will see
that there is no output file. While we successfully created a topic
model, we did not save the output! At the command prompt, type

``` 
bin\mallet train-topics  --input tutorial.mallet --num-topics 20 --output-state topic-state.gz --output-topic-keys tutorial_keys.txt --output-doc-topics tutorial_compostion.txt 
```

Here, we have told MALLET to create a topic model (`train-topics`) and
everything with a double hyphen afterwards sets different parameters

This command

-   opens your `tutorial.mallet` file
-   trains MALLET to find 20 topics
-   outputs every word in your corpus of materials and the topic it
    belongs to into a compressed file (`.gz`; see www.gzip.org on how to
    unzip this)
-   outputs a text document showing you what the top key words are for
    each topic (`tutorial_keys.txt`)
-   and outputs a text file indicating the breakdown, by percentage, of
    each topic within each original text file you imported
    (`tutorial_composition.txt`). (To see the full range of possible
    parameters that you may wish to tweak, type
    `bin\mallet train-topics –help` at the prompt.)

Type `dir`. Your outputted files will be at the bottom of the list of
files and directories in `C:\Mallet`. Open `tutorial_keys.txt` in a word
processor (Figure 9). You are presented with a series of paragraphs. The
first paragraph is topic 0; the second paragraph is topic 1; the third
paragraph is topic 2; etc. (The output begins counting at 0 rather than
1; so if you ask it to determine 20 topics, your list will run from 0 to
19). The second number in each paragraph is the *Dirichlet parameter* for
the topic. This is related to an option which we did not run, and so its
default value was used (this is why every topic in this file has the
number 2.5).

{% include figure.html filename="fig-9-tutorial-key-words-in-Word.png" caption="Figure 9: Keywords Shown in a Word Processor" %}

If when you ran the topic model routine you had included

``` 
--optimize-interval 20
```

as below

``` 
bin\mallet train-topics  --input tutorial.mallet  --num-topics 20 --optimize-interval 20 --output-state topic-state.gz  --output-topic-keys tutorial_keys.txt --output-doc-topics tutorial_composition.txt
```

the output might look like this:

``` 
0 0.02995 xi ness regular asia online cinema established alvida acclaim veenr commercial 
```

That is, the first number is the topic (topic 0), and the second number
gives an indication of the *weight* of that topic. In general, including
`–optimize-interval` leads to better topics.

### The composition of your documents

What topics compose your documents? The answer is in the
`tutorial_composition.txt` file. To stay organized, import the
`tutorial_composition.txt` file into a spreadsheet (Excel, Open Office,
etc). You will have a spreadsheet with a \#doc, source, topic,
proportion columns. All subsequent columns run topic, proportion, topic,
proportion, etc., as in figure 10.

{% include figure.html filename="fig-10-topic-composition.png" caption="Figure 10: Topic Composition" %}

You can see that doc\# 0 (ie, the first document loaded into MALLET),
`elizabeth_needham.txt` has topic 2 as its principal topic, at about
15%; topic 8 at 11%, and topic 1 at 8%. As we read along that first
column of topics, we see that `zinta.txt` also has topic 2 as its
largest topic, at 23%. The topic model suggests a connection between
these two documents that you might not at first have suspected.

If you have a corpus of text files that are arranged in chronological
order (e.g., `1.txt` is earlier than `2.txt`), then you can graph this
output in your spreadsheet program, and begin to see changes over time,
as Robert Nelson has done in [Mining the Dispatch][].

How do you know the number of topics to search for? Is there a *natural*
number of topics? What we have found is that one has to run the
train-topics with varying numbers of topics to see how the composition
file breaks down. If we end up with the majority of our original texts
all in a very limited number of topics, then we take that as a signal
that we need to increase the number of topics; the settings were too
coarse. There are computational ways of searching for this, including
using MALLETs `hlda command`, but for the reader of this tutorial, it is
probably just quicker to cycle through a number of iterations (but for
more see Griffiths, T. L., & Steyvers, M. (2004). Finding scientific
topics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 101, 5228-5235).

### Getting your own texts into MALLET

The `sample data` folder in MALLET is your guide to how you should
arrange your texts. You want to put everything you wish to topic model
into a single folder within `c:\mallet`, ie `c:\mallet\mydata`. Your
texts should be in `.txt` format (that is, you create them with Notepad,
or in Word choose `Save As -> MS Dos text`). You have to make some
decisions. Do you want to explore topics at a paragraph by paragraph
level? Then each `txt` file should contain one paragraph. Things like
page numbers or other identifiers can be indicated in the name you give
the file, e.g., `pg32_paragraph1.txt`. If you are working with a diary,
each text file might be a single entry, e.g., `april_25_1887.txt`. (Note
that when naming folders or files, do not leave spaces in the name.
Instead use underscores to represent spaces). If the texts that you are
interested in are on the web, you might be able to [automate this
process][].

### Further Reading about Topic Modeling

To see a fully worked out example of topic modeling with a body of
materials culled from webpages, see [Mining the Open Web with Looted
Heritage Draft][].

You can grab the data for yourself at [Figshare.com][], which includes a
number of `.txt` files. Each individual `.txt` file is a single news
report.

    'Methods' section is especially important, in that it discusses
    preparing text for this sort of analysis.
