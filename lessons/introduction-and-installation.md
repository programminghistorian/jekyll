Lesson Goals
------------

This first lesson in our section on dealing with Online Sources is
designed to get you and your computer set up to start programming. We
will focus on installing the relevant software – all free and reputable
– and finally we will help you to get your toes wet with some simple
programming that provides immediate results.

In this opening module you will install the [Python programming
language][], the [Beautiful Soup HTML/XML parser][], and a text editor.
Screencaps provided here come from [Komodo Edit][], but you can use any
text editor capable of working with Python. Here's a list of other
options: [Python Editors][]. Once everything is installed, you will
write your first programs, "Hello World" in Python and HTML.

the Python Programming Language
-------------------------------

The first programming language we will introduce in the Programming
Historian is Python, a free, open source language. Unless otherwise
noted, we will be using **Python v.2** throughout. Version 3 is
available but we have elected to stick with version 2 for now because
it’s the most widely used version and it is the one that ships
preinstalled on new Macs. Python 3 has different syntax (think grammar
rules) and if you are trying to use Python 3 with the Programming
Historian, you may run into difficulties. We welcome version 3
translations of any of our lessons.

Backup Your Work!
-----------------

Before you download or install any new software, it is crucial that you
make backups of your work. Each day before you do any programming, make
sure to back up your [Zotero][] database. At the end of a day’s work,
make another backup of the Zotero database and of any programs that
you’ve written that day. You should back up your whole computer at least
weekly, and preferably more frequently. It is also a good idea to make
off-site backups of your work, so that you don't lose everything if
something happens to your computer or to your home or office. Sites like
[Jungle Disk][] and [Dropbox][] provide easy-to-use and relatively
inexpensive online backup options.

### Choose Your Operating System

Step 1 – Install and Set Up Software
------------------------------------

In order to work through the techniques in this website, you will need to
download and install some freely available software. We have provided
instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux. Once you have installed the
software for your operating system, move on to '[Viewing HTML Files][]'.
If you run into trouble with our instructions or find something that
doesn't work on your platform, please let us know.
