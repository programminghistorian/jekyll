# Lesson Index

Our lessons are organized by typical phases of the research process, as well as general topics. Use the buttons to filter lessons by category. If you canâ€™t find a skill, technology, or tool you're looking for, please [let us know]({{ site.baseurl }}/feedback)!

This creates a variable you can call to just pull lessons (which are the only pages with 'Lesson: true' in their front matter, courtesy of config.yml setting the scope of site URLs containing the 'lessons' path to follow 'lesson: true').

{% assign alllessons = site.pages | where: "english-lesson" , "true" %}

Pulls the parts of the page that filter and sort lesson info from includes/lesson-index.html. Note that a separate file, includes/lesson_describe.html, creates the actual display of lesson info on the page, and includes/lesson-slug.html creates the appropriate lesson slug (used in the link to individual lesson pages, avatar links, and image paths.).
