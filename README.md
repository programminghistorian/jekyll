This is the main repository for the _Programming Historian_ (<http://programminghistorian.org>), where we keep the live site that you can see there. We have a companion repository under development [_Programming Historian Submissions_](https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions).

If you have suggestions for the site, please click on the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues) above, and click [New Issue](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/new). You can also check out detailed instructions for contributors and reviewers on our [contributions page](http://programminghistorian.org/contribute).

If you have any questions, please contact [Jessica Parr](mailto:jarr1129@gmail.com).
