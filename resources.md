### Other Resources

As you’re working through the tutorials here, you will want to have a
few key resources open in your browser. Until you become familiar with
the programming languages that we’re using, it is nice to have a few
different introductory treatments to look at. There are many good online
resources like the ones listed below, which are great for Python and
HTML learning. Other programming languages have equally valuable sets of
introductory texts and websites which you can find online.

-   [Python for Non-programmers][]
-   [LearnPython.org][] This tutorial offers in-browser coding windows.
-   [Non-Programmer’s Tutorial for Python 2.6][]
-   [W3 Schools HTML Tutorial][]
-   [W3 Schools HTML5 Tutorial][]

As you proceed (or if you already have some programming experience)
you’ll probably prefer more general references like:

-   [Python for Programmers][]
-   [Python documentation page][]
-   [Python tutorial][]
-   [Python library reference][]
-   Pilgrim, [Dive into Python][]

We also like to have a few printed books ready-to-hand, especially

-   Lutz, *[Learning Python][]*
-   Lutz, *[Programming Python][]*
-   Martelli, Ravenscroft and Ascher, *[Python Cookbook][]*
