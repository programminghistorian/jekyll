The Programming Historian always welcomes suggestions and submissions from the community.

What we are looking for
-----------------------

There is no single kind or standard lesson at The Programming Historian.
We do insist that all lessons have a clearly defined goal and are
written with a particular audience in mind. Ideally, readers must
understand at the outset exactly what skills or results they will
achieve by working on a lesson, and the lesson will conclude only after
it has provided a tangible skill to the reader. We aim for lesson that
take between 30 minutes and 1 hour to complete. More expansive lessons
can be divided into smaller sub-lessons that can be worked through in
sequence.

Lesson’s We’d Really Love to See
--------------------------------

This isn’t a prescriptive list by any means. But sometimes we editors
come across techniques or tools we think would make great lessons, so we
put them here in case you’re looking for inspiration.

Why Bother
----------

From our own experiences as well as from our authors, we know that the
difficult job of writing technically challenging but accessible
tutorials is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills
and actively engage in the community by passing on some of the tacit
knowledge gained along the way.

Another reason to get involved is that participation brings distinct
professionalization benefits. We prominently feature the names of
authors and reviewers on all of our lesson pages, as well as the
contributors page, and new lessons tend to be frequently tweeted and
retweeted. Because we average more than 60,000 unique visitors per year,
*The Programming Historian* remains a vibrant and visible site for
community collaboration and education.

Editorial Policy
----------------

### Open Source, Open Access

The Programming Historian is committed to open source and open access
principles. All contributed lessons must make use of open source
programming languages and open source software whenever possible. This
policy is meant to minimize costs for all parties, and to allow the
greatest possible level of participation. We believe everyone should be
able to benefit from these tutorials, not just those with large research
budgets for expensive proprietary software.

The Programming Historian also emphasizes sharing credit where it is
due. Upon acceptance, authors agree to release their lesson under a
Creative Commons [Attribution 3.0 Unported][] license, also known as a
“CC-BY” license. This means that you have the right to post your lesson
to your blog, to your local newspaper, or to anywhere else you see fit
without asking anyone’s permission. However, you grant PH and anyone
else interested in your work the right to do the same as long as they
list you as the author. This allows the lessons to have the greatest
possible diffusion and impact.

### Modularity

Rather than offering lessons in a set order, we present more of a
smorgasbord, enabling readers to pick and choose whatever particular
lessons seem most relevant for their task at hand. We aim for our
lessons build and draw upon each other. As a author, this means that you
don’t need to explain in detail smaller tasks, technologies, or
techniques that have been explained in their own tutorials, but can
focus on the problem you’re most interested in. This allows authors to
write tutorials more directly aligned with their interests, and for us
to minimize our repetition across lessons.

### Technical Sustainability

Lessons must make every effort to use stable, non-deprecated (or soon to
be deprecated) techniques, languages and software. Alpha versions of
software should be avoided; Beta versions only used if they are
extremely stable. We discourage operating-system specific tutorials, but
we are happy to work with you to get your tutorial tested on other
platforms so that everyone can learn from them.
