Attached to all pages, this include will check two things:

1. IF this page is known to be a translation of another page because its YAML contains an `original` tag, then the first section of this workflow searches across the site to find the 1 matching page that is the `translation_source`

1. Are there are any translations of this page elsewhere on the site. This checks both for
  a) Direct translations that have this page listed under their 'original' metadata
  b) Indirect translations that share the same 'original' as this page
Those 0+ page objects are saved to the variable `translation_candidates` available when rendering the rest of the page.

{% include page-slug.html %}

{% assign target_slug = page.original %}
{% assign translation_sources = site.pages | where_exp: "item", "item.url contains target_slug" | where_exp: "item", "item.url != page.url" | where_exp: "item", "item.name != 'redirect.html'" %}
{% for s in translation_sources %}
  {% assign last_component = s.url | split: "/" | last %}
  {% if last_component == target_slug %}
    {% assign translation_source = s %}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

A future version of Jekyll will allow binary boolean operators (and/or) inside a where_exp filter, however the gh-pages version of Jekyll does not yet contain this. therefore, we run both expressions separately, then take the union of pages returned.

{% assign translation_candidates = indirect_translation_candidates | concat: direct_translation_candidates %}
