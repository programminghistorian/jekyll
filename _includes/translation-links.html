Attached to all pages, this include will check two things:

1. First, if there are any translations of this page elsewhere on the site. Those 0+ page objects are saved to the variable `translation_candidates` available when rendering the rest of the page.

2. IF this page is known to be a translation of another page because its YAML contains an `original` tag, then the second section of this workflow searches across the site to find the 1 matching page that is the `translation_source`

{% assign translation_candidates = site.pages | where_exp: "item", "item.original contains slug" | where_exp: "item", "item.url != page.url" %}

{% assign target_slug = page.original %}
{% assign translation_source = site.pages | where_exp: "item", "item.url contains target_slug" | where_exp: "item", "item.url != page.url" | where_exp: "item", "item.name != 'redirect.html'" %}
