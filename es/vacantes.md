### Description

_Programming Historian_ is seeking an outstanding Digital Humanities Publishing Assistant to join our global-facing digital humanities team. This is a remote part-time role, offered on an open-ended basis subject to a successful 3-month probationary period. 

The candidate’s primary role is to assist our Publishing Manager with providing the services that underpin our multilingual publishing workflow, in support of 4 editorial teams.

These include but are not limited to:

- **Publication support**: our authors, readers, and supporters expect us to publish high-quality lessons, so your role would include tasks such as processing new submission materials, reviewing metadata and typesetting, or undertaking sustainability and accessibility checks. With the support of the Publishing Manager, the candidate may also contribute to the development of training materials for editorial team members, authors, translators and reviewers.  

- **Documentation and record-keeping support**: as a Charity and a Ltd company, we have a responsibility to maintain accurate records of our activities and decision-making. Your role would include taking minutes at meetings, as well as supporting the administration and maintenance of our public-facing and internal records.  

- **Communications support**: we interact with our community and share information across a range of platforms, so your role would include contributing to the creation of engaging and accessible content, assisting with community-building initiatives and events, as well as helping to promote and disseminate our resources.  

### Candidate Profile

The successful candidate will have a keen attention to detail, excellent organisational and communication skills, and work well in a remote working environment. You will have a demonstrable knowledge of humanities and/or digital humanities in an academic setting. You will possess a high level of cultural awareness and the ability to communicate clearly in English with scholars for whom English is not a first language, both verbally and in writing. This role will involve working within a multilingual Project Team, so a strong familiarity ([CEFA A2 or above](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/table-1-cefr-3.3-common-reference-levels-global-scale)) with at least one other language (Spanish, French, Portuguese) is a huge asset, as is a willingness to learn one (see below for the annual budget that will be available to the successful candidate for use, in part, for continuing professional development). Much of our publication workflow involves working with GitHub (github.com), and while training will be provided, you must be comfortable working with a range of technologies and be interested in learning about new technology and their applications within humanities research.

The _Programming Historian_ project is a world-leading pedagogy and digital methods initiative committed to open educational resources and open digital pedagogy. It was the first publication of its kind dedicated to making digital humanities skills accessible to learners anywhere in the world, for free. The project now publishes in four languages (English, Spanish, French, Portuguese), each of which is supported by a team of academics working across the digital humanities and social sciences. Our four journals have published more than 200 peer-reviewed tutorials, reaching millions of readers around the world.

### Benefits

- A flexible working pattern to be determined with the candidate 
- 15 days annual leave per annum, plus UK Bank Holidays and all [closure days as defined by UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/term-dates-and-closures/term-dates-and-closures-2022-23)   
- £1000 annual budget for equipment, research, or learning
