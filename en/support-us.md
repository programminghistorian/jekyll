# Supporting the _Programming Historian_

The Programming Historian is a volunteer-driven project. We are committed to open source values and our content will not disappear behind a paywall. However, in order for it to grow, improve, and sustain our work, in 2018 the [Editorial Board of The Programming Historian](/en/project-team) started to put in place financial and policy-based mechanisms for accepting sponsorship and donations. This enables us to:

- Maintain our infrastructure.
- Bring in professional services that enhance the quality of our publications.
- Improve our community outreach and internationalisation.
- Protect The Programming Historian from changes to service agreements of those ‘free’ services upon which we rely.
