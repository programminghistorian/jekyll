# Supporting the _Programming Historian_

The Programming Historian is a volunteer-driven project. We are committed to open source values and our content will not disappear behind a paywall. However, in order for it to grow, improve, and sustain our work, in 2018 the [Editorial Board of The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/project-team) started to put in place financial and policy-based mechanisms for accepting sponsorship and donations. This enables us to:

- Maintain our infrastructure.
- Bring in professional services that enhance the quality of our publications.
- Improve our community outreach and internationalisation.
- Protect The Programming Historian from changes to service agreements of those ‘free’ services upon which we rely.

## Supporters

The project is grateful for the following support:

- Web development is supported by the [dSHARP lab at Carnegie Mellon University](http://dsharp.library.cmu.edu/) and the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/) [2018-Present]
- Ongoing hosting support from the Roy Rosenzweig Center for New Media ([RRCHNM](http://chnm.gmu.edu/)) [2011-Present].
- Funding for a writing workshop in Bogota, Colombia, supported by the [British Academy](https://www.britac.ac.uk/) [2018].
- Seed funding and project management support from the Network in Canadian History & Environment ([NiCHE](http://niche-canada.org/)) [2011-2013].

## Donate to Us

We hope to have a donation mechanism in place by mid-2019.

## Sponsor Us

If you represent an organisation or group who are interested in sponsoring The Programming Historian, please contact [James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker) to discuss. Sponsorship can be financial, in-kind, or a combination of both. Sponsorship length and value are negotiable.

All sponsorship is subject to [agreement](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/wiki/Programming-Historian-Governance) by the [Editorial Board](https://programminghis) of The Programming Historian. In order to avoid perceived conflicts of interest, safeguard our peer review process, and ensure our academic integrity, the Editorial Board have agreed **not to accept** the following forms of sponsorship

- Headline Sponsorship. For example, 'The Programming Historian in association with..' or 'The Programming Historian powered by..'.
- Individual or Selective Lesson Sponsorship. For example, your logo on a single lesson page or lessons pages about a single tool or set of approaches.

## Haven't got any money?

The Programming Historian runs on the far-from-endless energy of volunteers, and we want to hear from anyone who shares our interest in teaching digital methods, forging new processes of peer review, and building diversity in the digital humanities community. So if you are unwilling or unable to donate to The Programming Historian, but want to contribute in some way, please see our '[Contribute to The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/contribute)' page where we’ve outlined common ways to contribute.

## Management of Donations and Sponsorship

Donations and sponsorship are managed by [James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker) on behalf of the [Editorial Board of The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/project-team).
