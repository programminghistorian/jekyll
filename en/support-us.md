# Supporting the _Programming Historian_

The Programming Historian is a volunteer-driven project. We are committed to open source values and our content will not disappear behind a paywall. However, in order for it to grow, improve, and sustain our work, in 2018 the [Editorial Board of The Programming Historian](/en/project-team) started to put in place financial and policy-based mechanisms for accepting sponsorship and donations. This enables us to:

- Maintain our infrastructure.
- Bring in professional services that enhance the quality of our publications.
- Improve our community outreach and internationalisation.
- Protect The Programming Historian from changes to service agreements of those ‘free’ services upon which we rely.

## Supporters

The project is grateful for the following support:

- Web development is supported by the [dSHARP lab at Carnegie Mellon University](http://dsharp.library.cmu.edu/) and the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/) [2018-Present]
- Ongoing hosting support from the Roy Rosenzweig Center for New Media ([RRCHNM](http://chnm.gmu.edu/)) [2011-Present].
- Funding to support establishing the Programming Historian as a legal entity provided by the [School of History, Art History and Philosophy, University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/hahp/) [2019]. 
- Funding for a writing workshop in Bogota, Colombia, supported by the [British Academy](https://www.britac.ac.uk/) [2018].
- Seed funding and project management support from the Network in Canadian History & Environment ([NiCHE](http://niche-canada.org/)) [2011-2013].

We hope to have a donation mechanism in place in 2019.

## Sponsor Us

In order to avoid perceived conflicts of interest, safeguard our peer review process, and ensure our academic integrity, the Editorial Board have agreed **not to accept** the following forms of sponsorship

- Individual or Selective Lesson Sponsorship. For example, your logo on a single lesson page or lessons pages about a single tool or set of approaches.

## Haven't got any money?

The Programming Historian runs on the far-from-endless energy of volunteers, and we want to hear from anyone who shares our interest in teaching digital methods, forging new processes of peer review, and building diversity in the digital humanities community. So if you are unwilling or unable to donate to The Programming Historian, but want to contribute in some way, please see our '[Contribute to The Programming Historian](/en/contribute)' page where we’ve outlined common ways to contribute.
