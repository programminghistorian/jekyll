# About the _Programming Historian_


## Peer Review
All tutorials at the _Programming Historian_ are rigorously peer reviewed, guided through the review process by one of our editors. Review involves a thorough exchange with the lesson editor to ensure the lesson works as intended and that all concepts are explained for a non-specialist reader, before the tutorial is sent to external reviewers.

Our peer review process is a bit different from what might be considered the traditional peer review process. We do not solicit reviews to judge whether a tutorial is “good enough” to be published. Rather, we consider the review process an integral component of a collaborative, productive, and sustainable effort for scholars to teach and learn from each other. Once a tutorial slips into our [editorial workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/author-guidelines), we do everything we can to make sure the tutorial becomes as useful as possible and published in a reasonable amount of time. Consult our [Reviewer Guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/reviewer-guidelines) for more information.


## Open Source
The _Programming Historian_ is committed to open source values. All contributed lessons make use of open source programming languages and software whenever possible. This policy is meant to minimize costs for all parties, and to allow the greatest possible level of participation. We believe everyone should be able to benefit from these tutorials, not just those with large research budgets for expensive proprietary software. Since 2016, a citable version of the _Programming Historian_ project has been deposited on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). The 2017 deposit is available at [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1046738](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1046738).

## Diversity Policy

The Programming Historian is committed to diversity, and we insist on a harassment-free space for all contributors to the project, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion, or technical experience. Our commitment to diversity extends to our Editorial Board, which has adopted a diversity policy to ensure that members from any one gender or any one nationality do not comprise more than 50% + 1 of the members on the board. This is to ensure that the project continues to benefit from diverse viewpoints. This policy is under perpetual review and we welcome suggestions on it from the community.

## Funding & Ownership

The project is grateful for the following support:

* Seed funding and project management support from the Network in Canadian History & Environment ([NiCHE](http://niche-canada.org/)) [2011-2013].
* Ongoing hosting support from the Roy Rosenzweig Center for New Media ([RRCHNM](http://chnm.gmu.edu/)) [2011-Present].
* Funding for a writing workshop in Bogota, Colombia, supported by the [British Academy](https://www.britac.ac.uk/) [2018].

The Programming Historian is a volunteer-driven project. It is published by the Editorial Board of the Programming Historian.
