# About the _Programming Historian_


## Peer Review
All tutorials at _Programming Historian_ are rigorously peer reviewed, guided through the review process by one of our editors. Review involves a thorough exchange with the lesson editor to ensure the lesson works as intended and that all concepts are explained for a non-specialist reader, before the tutorial is sent to external reviewers.

The review process is an integral component of a collaborative, productive, and sustainable effort for scholars to teach and learn from each other. Once a tutorial slips into our [editorial workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/author-guidelines), we do everything we can to make sure the tutorial becomes as useful as possible and published in a reasonable amount of time. Consult our [Reviewer Guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/reviewer-guidelines) for more information.


## Open Source
The _Programming Historian_ team is committed to open source values. All contributed lessons make use of open source programming languages and software whenever possible. This policy is meant to minimize costs for all parties, and to allow the greatest possible level of participation. We believe everyone should be able to benefit from these tutorials, not just those with large research budgets for expensive proprietary software. Since 2016, a citable version of the _Programming Historian_ project has been deposited on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). The 2020 deposit is available at [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.42446552](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4244655). Since 2018, the [UK Web Archive](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/) has made regular crawls of the _Programming Historian_. These are archived and made publicly available [via their website](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/en/archive/*/http://programminghistorian.org/).

## Diversity Policy

The _Programming Historian_ team is committed to diversity, and we insist on a harassment-free space for all contributors to the project, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or technical experience. Our commitment to diversity extends to our Editorial Board, which has adopted a diversity policy whereby we aim to ensure that members from any one gender or any one nationality do not comprise more than 50% + 1 of the members on the team. We encourage individuals from under-represented groups to apply to our Editorial Board when positions are advertised, and we commit to considering and discussing a candidate's potential to offer different perspectives to those already on the team when deciding between two equally qualified candidates. This policy is designed to ensure that the project continues to benefit from diverse viewpoints. This policy is under perpetual review and we welcome suggestions on it from the community.

## History of the Project

The _Programming Historian_ was founded in 2008 by William J. Turkel and Alan MacEachern. It focused heavily on the Python programming language and was published open access as a *Network in Canadian History & Environment* (NiCHE) ‘Digital Infrastructure’ project. In 2012, _Programming Historian_ expanded its editorial team and launched as an open access peer reviewed scholarly journal of methodology for digital historians. In 2016 we added a Spanish Language publication to the initial English-language publication and in 2017 started publishing translated lessons under the title *[Programming Historian en español]({{site.baseurl}}/es)*. In 2018 we [hosted our first Spanish-language writing workshop](/posts/bogota-workshop-report) and issued a call for [new lessons in Spanish](/posts/convocatoria-de-tutoriales). In the same year we added a French language publication and launched *[Programming Historian en français]({{site.baseurl}}/fr)* in 2019. A year later, we were joined by a Portuguese-speaking team and launched *[Programming Historian em português]({{site.baseurl}}/pt)* in early 2021.
