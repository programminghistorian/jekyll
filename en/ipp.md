Thank you for your interest in the Institutional Partnership Programme, which provides the core support for the *Programming Historian*'s award winning open access publications. We cannot do our work without your valued support.

| $1,700 CAD  | $700 CAD | $275 CAD  | 

If your institution has resource to offer us even greater support, we also welcome Partnerships at our Gold Tier. Gold Tier Partnership rates are £3,000 GBP / $4,200 USD / €3,600 EUR / $5,100 CAD.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. What budgets do other institutions draw this contribution from?
	- Some of our partners have dedicated 'Open Access' budgets to support work such as ours. Others have 'Development' budgets or draw upon training budgets and then use our materials for training workshops. We are also able to invoice your contribution as either a subscription or a donation, as best suits your circumstances.
2. Can you provide usage statistics for my university?
 - No, we don't track users in that way, and we don't have a sign-in system for readers.
3. Will my contribution be used on a publication of my choice?
 - Sponsors contribute to the shared infrastructure used across all of our publications. By becoming an IPP sponsor, you strengthen the resources in your chosen language, as well as those across our offering.
