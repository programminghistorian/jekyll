## Frequently Asked Questions

1. What budgets do other institutions draw this contribution from?
	- Some of our partners have dedicated 'Open Access' budgets to support work such as ours. Others have 'Development' budgets or draw upon training budgets and then use our materials for training workshops. We are also able to invoice your contribution as either a subscription or a donation, as best suits your circumstances.
2. Can you provide usage statistics for my university?
 - No, we don't track users in that way, and we don't have a sign-in system for readers.
3. Will my contribution be used on a publication of my choice?
 - Sponsors contribute to the shared infrastructure used across all of our publications. By becoming an IPP sponsor, you strengthen the resources in your chosen language, as well as those across our offering.
