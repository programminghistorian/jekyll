# Contribute to The Programming Historian

The _Programming Historian_ runs on the far-from-endless energy of volunteers, and we want to hear from anyone who shares our interest in teaching digital methods, forging new processes of peer review, and building diversity in the digital humanities community. Below we've outlined common ways to contribute; please let us know any ideas you have for broadening participation.

## Write a new lesson

Writing a tutorial is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills and actively engage in the digital humanities community.

We don't simply accept or reject articles like traditional journals. Our editors collaborate with you to help craft your essay to be as clear and as useful as possible--a great way to improve your technical writing skills. Please read more about our [submission process]({{site.baseurl}}/en/author-guidelines).

If you'd like to propose a lesson (for you or for someone else to write), email {% include managing-editor.html lang=page.lang %}.


## Edit lessons

Our editorial board members help facilitate peer review and work with authors closely to make improvements to their lessons. Our [guidelines for editors](editor-guidelines) is meant to ensure that everyone, from authors to reviewers to members of the wider community, receive a fair and consistent experience during peer review.

From time to time we may advertise that we are seeking more editors.

## Translate a lesson

If you are fluent in more than one of our publication languages (French, English, Spanish, Portuguese), you are invited to get in touch with us about translating one of our published Programming Historian lessons from one language to another. This will help us to assist building multilingual digital humanities communities, and to build your language, method, and technological skills.

We are seeking rigorous and readable translations that take into account the Spanish-language, the French-language and the Portuguese-language research contexts and the resources available in our respective communities. If you are interested in collaborating, consult our instructions for authors and translators [in Spanish](/es/guia-para-autores.html), [in French](/fr/consignes-auteurs.html) and [in Portuguese](/pt/directrizes-autor.html).

## Provide feedback or report problems

We welcome [feedback](feedback.html) on any aspect of the _Programming Historian_. Let us know what we can do to make the project better!

We are especially grateful for tips about lessons that seem to be broken. As URLs change and as new versions of software and platforms are released, lessons develop glitches over time. Please help us keep the _Programming Historian_ up to date by letting us know about these when you come across them in the course of your reading.


## Add us to your Library Catalog
