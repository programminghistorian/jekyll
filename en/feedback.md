# We Appreciate Your Feedback

Have you followed the instructions in a lesson meticulously and still run into an error? Thank you for taking the time to report a problem with one of our lessons. Your assistance is crucial for helping us maintain the best possible lessons!

We define bugs as: "An error in a computer program that produces an unexpected result or that behaves different from the instructions in a lesson." Note that we cannot attend to errors caused by the user editing the code or changing materials (datasets, input files, etc.)

First, we ask that you check on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) if someone has already flagged the problem and, in such case, that you leave a comment. If the issue has not been reported, follow one of these options:

## Option 1: Open an Issue on GitHub
This is our preferred way of handling feedback because all our editors are able to see and respond to your issue.

First, [sign up for a free, personal GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) if you don't already have one. Log in if you already have an account.

Then, go to the [issues page](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues?state=open) for our Repository.

Create a new issue with a descriptive title and completing as much information as you can give following the prompt we provide.

For more information about GitHub issues, read the GitHub Guide on [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).


## Option 2: Make a Pull Request
If you believe you know how to fix the problem in the lesson, you may wish to consider forking our repository and making a pull request.

For more information on pull requests, see the GitHub Guide on [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) or Rich Jones's tutorial on [How to GitHub](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/).


## Option 3: Email or Tweet
If you are not familiarized at all with GitHub, you can also send an email to {% include managing-editor.html lang=page.lang %} or one of the other members of our [Project Team](project-team.html). 

## Further Resources on Git and GitHub

Using Git and GitHub can be fairly simple once you get the hang of it.  If you are interested in learning more and contributing, the [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) website is a great place to start.
