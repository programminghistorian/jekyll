Have you followed the instructions in a lesson meticulously and still run into an error? Thank you for taking the time to report a problem with one of our lessons. Your assistance is crucial for helping us maintain the best possible lessons!

We define bugs as: "An error in a computer program that produces an unexpected result or that behaves different from the instructions in a lesson." Note that we cannot attend to errors caused by the user editing the code or changing materials (datasets, input files, etc.)

First, we ask that you check on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) if someone has already flagged the problem and, in such case, that you leave a comment. If the issue has not been reported, follow one of these options:

<div class="alert alert-info">
Please, do not create a Pull Request with the correction.
</div>


## Option 1: Email

Send an email to our [Publishing Assistant](mailto:admin@programminghistorian.org).

Please include the following information in your message:

- The full title of the lesson
- The system you are using (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- Version numbers of the relevant software you are using
- The exact steps you took that caused the problem

## Option 2: Open an Issue on GitHub

First, [sign up for a free, personal GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) if you don't already have one. Log in if you already have an account.

Then, go to the [issues page](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues?state=open) of our Repository.

Create a new issue with a descriptive title and complete as much information as you can, following the prompts we provide.
