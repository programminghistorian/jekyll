# We Appreciate Your Feedback

Run into code that doesn't work?

Does a command or concept need a clearer explanation?

Find an awkward phrase that keeps tripping you up?

Thank you for taking the time to report a problem or suggest a change. Your assistance is crucial for helping us maintain the best possible lessons!


## Option 1: Email or Tweet
Contact {% include managing-editor.html lang=page.lang %} or one of the other members of our [Project Team](project-team.html). You can also tweet [@ProgHist](https://twitter.com/proghist).

## Option 2: Open an Issue on GitHub
This is our preferred way of handling feedback since all our editors are able to see and respond to your issue.

First, [sign up for a free, personal GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) if you don't already have one. Log in if you already have an account.

Then, go to the [issues page](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues?state=open) for our Repository.

Glance at the open issues to see if the problem you have identified has already been reported. If it has, but you have additional information to share, leave a comment on that issue.

If your issue has not been reported, create a new issue with a descriptive title and as much information about the problem as you can give.

For more information about GitHub issues, read the GitHub Guide on [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).


## Option 3: Suggest a Particular Change
To suggest or make minor changes to a lesson, first navigate to the [lessons directory](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/tree/gh-pages/en/lessons) and click on the relevant lesson.

Next, click on the history button:

Now click on the most recent commit for the lesson:

Next, to comment on a line, hover over a line number, and a blue plus-sign will appear; clicking on it will open a comment box for that particular line. The line that needs fixing may be hidden; if so, click on the expand icon to show hidden lines.

Editors will be notified of these comments and can then incorporate your suggestions into the lesson. As much as we strive for openness, only _Programming Historian_ editors can make changes directly to the lessons at this time.


## Option 4: Make a Pull Request

If you believe you know how to fix the problem in the lesson, you may wish to consider forking our repository and making a pull request.

For more information on pull requests, see the GitHub Guide on [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) or Rich Jones's tutorial on [How to GitHub](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/).

## Further Resources on Git and GitHub

Using Git and GitHub can be fairly simple once you get the hang of it.  If you are interested in learning more and contributing, the [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) website is a great place to start.
