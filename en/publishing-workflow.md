# Publishing Workflow

Our publishing workflow moves through eight phases: **Proposal**, **Submission**, **Initial Edit**, **Revision 1**, **Open Peer Review**, **Revision 2**, **Sustainability + Accessibility**, and **Publication**. It is supported by the professional services of our Publishing Team, guided by our Managing Editors, with the expertise of a cohort of volunteer editors from our Project Team.
