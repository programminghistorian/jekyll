<a name="objectives" class="anchor" href="#objectives"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, you will first learn the basics of Markdown&#8212;an easy to read and write markup syntax for plain text&#8212;as well as <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://johnmacfarlane.net']);">Pandoc</a>, a command line tool that converts plain text into a number of beautifully formatted file types: PDF, .docx, HTML, LaTeX, slide decks, and more.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> With Pandoc as your digital typesetting tool, you can use Markdown syntax to add figures, a bibliography, formatting, and easily change citation styles from Chicago to MLA (for instance), all using plain text.</p>
<p>The tutorial assumes no prior technical knowledge, but it scales with experience, as we often suggest more advanced techniques towards the end of each section. These are clearly marked and can be revisited after some practice and experimentation.</p>
<p>Instead of following this tutorial in a mechanical way, we recommend you strive to understand the solutions offered here as a <em>methodology</em>, which may need to be tailored further to fit your environment and workflow. The installation of the necessary tools presents perhaps the biggest barrier to participation. Allot yourself enough time and patience to install everything properly, or do it with a colleague who has a similar set-up and help each other out. Consult the <a href="#useful-resources"> Useful Resources</a> section below if you get stuck.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<h1>
<a name="philosophy" class="anchor" href="#philosophy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Philosophy</h1>
<p>Writing, storing, and retrieving documents are activities central to the humanities research workflow. And yet, many authors base their practice on proprietary tools and formats that sometimes fall short of even the most basic requirements of scholarly writing. Perhaps you can relate to being frustrated by the fragility of footnotes, bibliographies, figures, and book drafts authored in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Nevertheless, most journals still insist on submissions in .docx format.</p>
<p>More than causing personal frustration, this reliance on proprietary tools and formats has long-term negative implications for the academic community. In such an environment, journals must outsource typesetting, alienating authors from the material contexts of publication and adding further unnecessary barriers to the unfettered circulation of knowledge.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>When you use MS Word, Google Docs, or Open Office to write documents, what you see is not what you get. Beneath the visible layer of words, sentences, and paragraphs lies a complicated layer of code understandable only to machines. Because of that hidden layer, your .docx and .pdf files depend on proprietary tools to be rendered correctly. Such documents are difficult to search, to print, and to convert into other file formats.</p>
<p>
Moreover, time spent formatting your document in MS Word or Open Office is wasted, because all that formatting is removed by the publisher during submission. Both authors and publishers would benefit from exchanging files with minimal formatting, leaving the typesetting to the final typesetting stage of the publishing process.</p>
<p>This is where Markdown shines. Markdown is a syntax for marking semantic elements within a document explicitly, not in some hidden layer. The idea is to identify units that are meaningful to humans, like titles, sections, subsections, footnotes, and illustrations. At the very least, your files will always remain comprehensible to you, even if the editor you are currently using stops working or &#8220;goes out of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Writing in this way liberates the author from the tool. Markdown can be written in any plain text editor and offers a rich ecosystem of software that can render that text into beautiful looking documents. For this reason, Markdown is currently enjoying a period of growth, not just as as means for writing scholarly papers but as a convention for online editing in general. </p>
<p>It is important to understand that Markdown is merely a convention. Markdown files are stored as plain text, further adding to the flexibility of the format. Plain text files have been around since the electronic typewriter. The longevity of this standard inherently makes plain text more sustainable and stable than proprietary formats. While files produced even ten years ago in Microsoft Word and Apple&#8217;s Pages can cause significant problems when opened with the latest version, it is still possible to open a file written in any number of &#8220;dead&#8221; plain text editors from the past several decades: AlphaPlus, Perfect Writer, Text Wizard, Spellbinder, WordStar, or Isaac Asmiov&#8217;s favorite SCRIPSIT 2.0, made by Radio Shack. Writing in plain text guarantees that your files will remain readable ten, fifteen, twenty years from now. In this tutorial, we outline a workflow that frees the researcher from proprietary word processing software and fragile file formats.</p>
<p>It is now possible to write a wide range of documents in one format&#8212;articles, blog posts, wikis, syllabi, and recommendation letters&#8212;using the same set of tools and techniques to search, discover, backup, and distribute our materials. Your notes, blog entries, code documentation, and wikis can all be authored in Markdown. Increasingly, many platforms like WordPress, Reddit, and GitHub support Markdown authorship natively. In the long term, your research will benefit from such unified workflows, making it easier to save, search, share, and organize your materials.   </p>
<h1>
<a name="principles" class="anchor" href="#principles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Principles</h1>
<p>Inspired by best practices in a variety of disciplines, we were guided by the following principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sustainability.</em> Plain text both ensures transparency and answers the standards of long-term preservation. MS Word may go the way of Word Perfect in the future, but plain text will always remain easy to read, catalog, mine, and transform. Furthermore, plain text enables easy and powerful versioning of the document, which is useful in collaboration and organizing drafts. Your plain text files will be accessible on cell phones, tablets, or, perhaps, on a low-powered terminal in some remote library. Plain text is backwards compatible and future-proof. Whatever software or hardware comes along next, it will be able to understand your plain text files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Preference for human-readable formats.</em> When writing in Word or Google Docs, what you see is not what you get. The .doc file contains hidden, automatically-generated formatting characters, creating an obfuscated typesetting layer that is difficult for the user to troubleshoot. Something as simple as pasting an image or text from the browser can have unpredictable effects on your document&#8217;s formatting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Separation of form and content.</em> Writing and formatting at the same time is distracting. The idea is to write first, and format later, as close as possible to the time of publication. A task like switching from Chicago to MLA formatting should be painless. Journal editors who want to save time on needless formatting and copy editing should be able to provide their authors with a formatting template which takes care of the typesetting minutia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Support for the academic apparatus.</em> The workflow needs to handle footnotes, figures, international characters, and bibliographies gracefully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Platform independence.</em> As the vectors of publication multiply, we need to be able to generate a multiplicity of formats including for slide projection, print, web, and mobile. Ideally, we would like to be able to generate the most common formats without breaking bibliographic dependencies. Our workflow needs to be portable as well&#8211;it would be nice to be able to copy a folder to a thumbdrive and know that it contains everything needed for publication. Writing in plain text means you can easily share, edit, and archive your documents in virtually any environment. For example, a syllabus written in Markdown can be saved as a PDF, printed as a handout, and converted into HTML for the web, all from the same file. Both web and print documents should be published from the same source and look similar, preserving the logical layout of the material. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Markdown and LaTeX answer all of these requirements. We chose Markdown (and not LaTeX) because it offers the most light-weight and clutter free syntax (hence, mark  <em>down</em>) and because when coupled with Pandoc it allows for the greatest flexibility in outputs (including .docx and .tex files).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<h1>
<a name="software-requirements" class="anchor" href="#software-requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="software"></a>Software Requirements</h1>
<p>We purposefully omit some of the granular, platform- or operating system-bound details of installing the software listed below. For example, it makes no sense to provide installation instructions for LaTeX, when the canonical online instructions for your operating system will always remain more current and more complete. Similarly, the mechanics of Pandoc installation are best explored by searching for &#8220;installing Pandoc&#8221; on Google, with the likely first result being Pandoc&#8217;s homepage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Plain text editor</strong>. Entering the world of plain-text editing expands your choice of innovative authoring tools dramatically. Search online for &#8220;markdown text editor&#8221; and experiment with your options. It does not matter what you use as long as it is explicitly a plain text editor. Notepad++ on Windows or TextWrangler on Macs are easy, free choices. Remember, since we are not tied to the tool, you can change editors at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command line terminal</strong>. Working &#8220;in the command line&#8221; is equivalent to typing commands into the terminal. On a Mac you simply need to use your finder for &#8220;Terminal&#8221;. On Windows, use PowerShell. Linux users are likely to be familiar with their terminals already. We will cover the basics of how to find and use the command line below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pandoc</strong>. Detailed, platform-specific installation instructions are available at <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://johnmacfarlane.net']);">the Pandoc website</a>. <em>Installation of Pandoc on your machine is crucial for this tutorial</em>, so be sure to take your time and click through the instructions. Pandoc was created and is maintained by John MacFarlane, Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. This is humanities computing at its best and will serve as the engine of our workflow. With Pandoc, you will be able to compile text and bibliography into beautifully formatted and flexible documents. Once you&#8217;ve followed the installation instructions, verify that Pandoc is installed by entering <code>pandoc --version</code> into the command line. We assume that you have at least version 1.12.3, released in January 2014.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following two pieces of software are recommended, but not required to complete this tutorial.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Zotero or Endnote</strong>. Bibliographic reference software like Zotero and Endnote are indispensable tools for organizing and formatting citations in a research paper. These programs can export your libraries as a BibTeX file (which you will learn more about in Case 2 below). This file, itself a formatted plain text document of all your citations, will allow you to quickly and easily cite references using <code>@tags</code>. It should be noted that it&#8217;s also possible to type all of your bibliographic references by hand, using <a href="https://github.com/dhcolumbia/pandoc-workflow/blob/master/pandoctut.bib" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://github.com']);">our bibliography</a> as a template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LaTeX</strong>. Detailed, platform-specific installation instructions available at <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://johnmacfarlane.net']);">the Pandoc website</a>. Although LaTeX is not covered in this tutorial, it is used by Pandoc for .pdf creation. Advanced users will often convert into LaTeX directly to have more granular control over the typesetting of the .pdf. Beginners may want to consider skipping this step. Otherwise, type <code>latex -v</code> to see if LaTeX was installed correctly (you will get an error if it was not and some information on the version if it was).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name="markdown-basics" class="anchor" href="#markdown-basics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Markdown Basics</h1>
<p>Markdown is a convention for structuring your plain-text documents semantically. The idea is to identify logical structures in your document (a title, sections, subsections, footnotes, etc.), mark them with some unobtrusive characters, and then &#8220;compile&#8221; the resulting text with a typesetting interpreter which will format the document consistently, according to a specified style.</p>
<p>Markdown conventions come in several &#8220;flavors&#8221; designed for use in particular contexts, such as blogs, wikis, or code repositories. The flavor of Markdown used by Pandoc is geared for academic use. Its conventions are described one the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://johnmacfarlane.net']);">Pandoc&#8217;s Markdown</a> page. One of its conventions include the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#yaml-metadata-block" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://johnmacfarlane.net']);">&#8220;YAML&#8221; block</a>, which contains some useful metadata.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now create a simple document in Markdown. Open a plain-text editor of your choice and begin typing. It should look like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">
---  
title: Plain Text Workflow  
author: Dennis Tenen, Grant Wythoff  
date: January 20, 2014  
---  
</pre>
<p>Pandoc-flavored Markdown stores each of the above values, and &#8220;prints&#8221; them in the appropriate location of your outputted document once you are ready to typeset. We will later learn to add other, more powerful fields to the YAML block. For now, let&#8217;s pretend we are writing a paper that contains three sections, each subdivided into two subsections. Leave a blank line after last three dashes in the YAML block and paste the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">
# Section 1  

## Subsection 1.1  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Next paragraph should start like this. Do not indent.

## Subsection 1.2
Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque  ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

# Section 2

## Subsection 2.1
</pre>
<p>Go ahead and enter some dummy text as well. Empty space is meaningful in Markdown: do not indent your paragraphs. Instead, separate paragraphs by using an blank line. Blank lines must also precede section headers.</p>
<p>You can use asterisks to add bold or italicized emphasis to your words, like this: <code>*italics*</code> and <code>**bold**</code>. We should also add a link and a footnote to our text to cover the basic components of an average paper. Type:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">
A sentence that needs a note.[ˆ1] 

[ˆ1]: my first footnote! And a [link](https://www.eff.org/).
</pre>
<p>When the text of the link and the address are the same it is faster to write <code>&lt;www.eff.org&gt;</code> instead of <code>[www.eff.org](www.eff.org)</code>. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s save our file before advancing any further. Create a new folder that will house this project. You are likely to have some system of organizing your documents, projects, illustrations, and bibliographies. But often, your document, its illustrations, and bibliography live in different folders, which makes them hard to track. Our goal is to create a single folder for each project, with all relevant materials included. The general rule of thumb is one project, one paper, one folder. Name your file something like <code>main.md</code>, where &#8220;md&#8221; stands for markdown.</p>
<p>Once your file is saved, let&#8217;s add an illustration. Copy an image (any small image) to your folder, and add the following somewhere in the body of the text: <code>![image caption](your_image.jpg)</code>. </p>
<p>At this point, your <code>main.md</code> should look something like the following. You can download this sample .md file <a href="https://github.com/dhcolumbia/pandoc-workflow/sample.md" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://github.com']);">here</a>.</p>

<p>As we shall do shortly, this plain text file can be rendered as a very nice PDF:</p>
<p><a href="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-12-at-4.57.17-PM.png" ><img src="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-12-at-4.57.17-PM-1024x621.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-12 at 4.57.17 PM" width="626" height="380" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2434" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to get an idea of how this kind of markup will be interpreted as HTML formatting, try <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://daringfireball.net']);">this online sandbox</a> and play around with various kinds of syntax. Remember that certain elements of <em>Pandoc</em>-flavored Markdown (such as the title block and footnotes) will not work in this web form, which only accepts the basics.</p>
<p>At this point, you should spend some time exploring some of other features of Markdown like quotations (referenced by <code>&gt;</code> symbol), bullet lists which start with <code>*</code> or <code>-</code>, verbatim line breaks which start with <code>|</code> (useful for poetry), tables, and a few of the other functions listed on Pandoc&#8217;s markdown page. </p>
<p>Pay particular attention to empty space and the flow of paragraphs. The documentation puts it succinctly when it defines a paragraph to be &#8220;one or more lines of text followed by one or more blank line.&#8221; Note that &#8220;newlines are treated as spaces&#8221; and that &#8220;if you need a hard line break, put two or more spaces at the end of a line.&#8221; The best way to understand what that means is to experiment freely. Use your editor&#8217;s preview mode or just run Pandoc to see the results of your experiments.</p>
<p>Above all, avoid the urge to format. Remember that you are identifying <em>semantic</em> units: sections, subsections, emphasis, footnotes, and figures. Even <code>*italics*</code> and <code>**bold**</code> in Markdown are not really formatting marks, but indicate different level of <em>emphasis</em>. The formatting will happen later, once you know the venue and the requirements of publication.</p>
<p>There are programs that allow you to watch a live preview of Markdown output as you edit your plain text file, which we detail below in the Useful Resources section. Few of them support footnotes, figures, and bibliographies however. To take full advantage of Pandoc, we recommend that you stick with simple, plain text files stored locally, on your computer. </p>

<a name="getting-in-touch-with-your-inner-terminal" class="anchor" href="#getting-in-touch-with-your-inner-terminal"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting in touch with your inner terminal</h1>
<p>Before we can start publishing our <code>main.md</code> file into other formats, we need to get oriented with working on the command line using your computer&#8217;s terminal program, which is the only (and best) way to use Pandoc.</p>
<p>The command line is a friendly place, once you get used to it. If you are already familiar with using the command line, feel free to skip this section. For others, it is important to understand that being able to use your terminal program directly will all you to use a broad range of powerful research tools that you couldn&#8217;t use otherwise, and can serve as a basis for more advanced work. For the purposes of this tutorial, you need to learn only a few, very simple commands. </p>
<p>First, open a command line window. If you are using a Mac, open Terminal in the ‘Applications/Utilities’ directory. On Windows, you&#8217;ll use PowerShell. On Windows 7 or later, click Start, type &#8220;powershell&#8221; in &#8220;Search programs and files,&#8221; and hit enter. For a detailed introduction to using the command line, see Zed A. Shaw&#8217;s excellent <em><a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://cli.learncodethehardway.org']);">Command Line Crash Course.</a></em></p>
<p>Once opened, you should see a text window and a prompt that looks something like this: <code>computer-name:~username $</code>. The tilde indicates your &#8220;home&#8221; directory, and in fact you can type <code>$ cd ~</code> at any point to return to your home directory. The dollar sign in your terminal window is just a prompt for you to type something. The dollar sign in the instructions here indicates you must type what follows into the terminal prompt (as opposed to typing it into your document); remember to hit enter after every command.</p>
<p>
It is very likely that your &#8220;Documents&#8221; folder is located here. Type <code>$ pwd</code> (= print working directory) and press enter to display the name of the current directory). Use <code>$ pwd</code> whenever you feel lost.</p>
<p>The command <code>$ ls</code> (= list), which simply lists the files in the current directory. Finally, you can use <code>$ cd></code> (= change directory) like <code>$ cd DIRECTORY_NAME</code> (where <code>DIRECTORY_NAME</code> is the name of the directory you&#8217;d like to navigate to). You can use <code>$ cd ..</code> to automatically move up one level in the directory structure (the parent directory of the directory you are currently in). Once you start typing the directory name, use the Tab key to auto complete the text&#8212;particularly useful for long directory names, or directories names that contain spaces.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
<p>These three terminal commands: <code>pwd</code>,  <code>ls</code>,  and <code>cd</code> are all you need for this tutorial. Practice them for a few minutes to navigate your documents folder and think about they way you have organized your files. If you&#8217;d like, follow along with your regular graphical file manager to keep your bearings.</p>

<a name="using-pandoc-to-convert-markdown-to-an-ms-word-document" class="anchor" href="#using-pandoc-to-convert-markdown-to-an-ms-word-document"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Pandoc to convert Markdown to an MS Word document</h1>
<p>We are now ready to typeset! Open your terminal window, use <code>$ pwd</code> and <code>$ cd</code> to navigate to the correct folder for your project. Once you are there, type <code>$ ls</code> in the terminal to list the files. If you see your .md file and your images, you are in the right place. To convert .md into .docx type: </p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
$ pandoc -o main.docx main.md
</pre>
<p>Open the file with MS Word to check your results. Alternatively, if you use Open or Libre Office you can run: </p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">pandoc -o project.odt main.md</pre>
</p>
<p>If you are new to the command line, imagine reading the above command as saying something like: &#8220;Pandoc, create an MS Word file out of my Markdown file.&#8221; The <code>-o</code> part is a &#8220;flag,&#8221; which in this case says something like &#8220;instead of me explicitly telling you the source and the target file formats, just guess by looking at the file extension.&#8221; Many options are available through such flags in Pandoc. You can see the complete list on <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://johnmacfarlane.net']);">Pandoc&#8217;s website</a> or by typing
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">man pandoc</pre>
<p> in the terminal.</p>
<p>Try running the command </p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ pandoc -o project.html main.md</pre>
<p>Now navigate back to your project directory. Can you tell what happened?
</p>
<p>More advanced users who have LaTeX installed may want to experiment by converting Markdown into .tex or specially formatted .pdf files. Once LaTeX is installed, a beautifully formatted PDF file can be created using the same command structure: </p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
$ pandoc -o main.pdf main.md
</pre>
<p>With time, you will be able to fine tune the formatting of PDF documents by specifying a LaTeX style file (saved to the same directory), and running something like: </p>
<p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ pandoc -H format.sty -o project.pdf --number-sections --toc project.tex
</pre>
<h1>
<a name="working-with-bibliographies" class="anchor" href="#working-with-bibliographies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Working with Bibliographies</h1>
<p>In this section, we will add a bibliography to our document and then convert from Chicago to MLA formats.</p>
<p>If you are not using a reference manger like Endnote or Zotero, you should. We prefer Zotero, because, like Pandoc, it was created by the academic community and like other open-source projects it is released under the GNU General Public License. Most importantly for us, your reference manager must have the ability to generate bibliographies in plain text format, to keep in line with our &#8220;everything in plain text&#8221; principle. Go ahead and open a reference manager of your choice and add some sample entries. When you are ready, find the option to export your bibliography in BibTeX (.bib) format. Save your .bib file in your project directory, and give it a reasonable title like &#8220;project.bib&#8221;.</p>
<p>The general idea is to keep your sources organized under one centralized bibliographic database, while generating specific and much smaller .bib files that will live in the same directory as your project. Go ahead and open your .bib file with the plain-text editor of your choice.  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Your .bib file should contain multiple entries that look something like this:  </p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">
@article{fyfe_digital_2011,
    title = {Digital Pedagogy Unplugged},
    volume = {5},
    url = {http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000106/000106.html},
    number = {3},
    urldate = {2013-09-28},
    author = {Fyfe, Paul},
    year = {2011},
    file = {fyfe_digital_pedagogy_unplugged_2011.pdf}
}
</pre>
<p>You will rarely have to edit these by hand (although you can). In most cases, you will simply &#8220;export&#8221; the .bib file from Zotero or from a similar reference manager. Take a moment to orient yourself here. Each entry consists of a document type, &#8220;article&#8221; in our case, a unique identifier (fyfe_digital_2011), and the relevant meta-data on title, volume, author, and so on. The thing we care most about is the unique ID which immediately follows the curly bracket in the first line of each entry. The unique ID is what allows us to connect the bibliography with the main document. Leave this file open for now and go back to your <code>main.md</code> file.</p>
<p>Edit the footnote in the first line of your <code>main.md</code> file to look like something like this, where <code>@fyfe_digital_2011</code> is replaced with one of the unique IDs from your <code>project.bib</code> file:</p>
<p><code>Some sentence that needs citation.^[@fyfe_digital_2011 argues that too.]</code></p>
<p>Once we run the markdown through Pandoc, &#8220;@fyfe_digital_2011&#8243; will be expanded to a full citation in the style of your choice. You can use the <code>@citation</code> syntax in any way you see fit: in-line with your text or in the footnotes. To generate a bibliography simply include a section called <code># Bibliography</code> at the end of document.</p>
<p>Now, go back to your metadata header at the top of your .md document, and specify the bibliography file to be used, like so:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
---
title: Plain Text Workflow
author: Dennis Tenen, Grant Wythoff
date: January 20, 2014
bibliography: project.bib
---
</pre>
<p>This tells Pandoc to look for your bibliography in the <code>project.bib</code> file, under the same directory as your <code>main.md</code>. Let&#8217;s see if this works. Save your file, switch to the terminal window and run: </p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
$ pandoc -S -o main.docx --filter pandoc-citeproc main.md
</pre>
<p>The upper case <code>S</code> flag stands for &#8220;smart&#8221;, a mode which produces &#8220;typographically correct output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes, &#8212; to em-dashes, &#8212; to en-dashes and &#8230; to ellipses.&#8221; The &#8220;pandoc-citeproc&#8221; filter parses all of your citation tags. The result should be a decently formatted MS Word file. If you have LaTeX installed, convert into .pdf using the same syntax for prettier results. Do not worry if things are not exactly the way you like them&#8212;remember, you are going to fine-tune the formatting all at once and at later time, as close as possible to the time of publication. For now we are just creating drafts based on reasonable defaults.</p>
<h2>
<a name="changing-citation-styles" class="anchor" href="#changing-citation-styles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changing citation styles</h2>
<p>The default citation style in Pandoc is Chicago author-date. We can specify a different style by using stylesheet, written in the &#8220;Citation Style Language&#8221; (yet another plain-text convention, in this case for describing citation styles) and denoted by the .csl file extension. Luckily, the CSL project maintains a repository of common citation styles, some even tailored for specific journals. Visit <a href="http://editor.citationstyles.org/about/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://editor.citationstyles.org']);">http://editor.citationstyles.org/about/</a> to find the .csl file for Modern Language Association, download <code>modern-language-association.csl</code>, and save to your project directory as <code>mla.csl</code>. Now we need to tell Pandoc to use the MLA stylesheet instead of the default Chicago. We do this by updating the YAML header:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
---
title: Plain Text Workflow
author: Dennis Tenen, Grant Wythoff
date: January 20, 2014
bibliography: project.bib
csl: mla.csl
---
</pre>
<p>You then simply use the same command: </p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ pandoc -S -o main.docx --filter pandoc-citeproc main.md</pre>
<p>Parse the command into English as you are typing. In my head, I translate the above into something like: &#8220;Pandoc, be smart about formatting, and output a Word Doc using the citation filter on my Markdown file (as you can guess from the extension).&#8221; As you get more familiar with citation stylesheets, consider adding your custom-tailored .csl files for journals in your field to the archive as a service to the community.</p>
<h1>
<a name="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h1>
<p>You should now be able to write papers in Markdown, to create drafts in multiple formats, to add bibliographies, and to easily change citation styles. A final look at the project directory will reveal a number of &#8220;source&#8221; files: your <code>main.md</code> file, <code>project.bib</code> file, your <code>mla.csl</code> file, and some images. Besides the source files you should see some some &#8220;target&#8221; files that we created during the tutorial: <code>main.docx</code> or <code>main.pdf</code>. Your folder should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Pandoc-tutorial/
    main.md
    project.bib
    mla.csl
    image.jpg
    main.docx
</code></pre>
<p>Treat you source files as an authoritative version of your text, and you target files as disposable &#8220;print outs&#8221; that you can easily generate with Pandoc on the fly. All revisions should go into <code>main.md</code>. The <code>main.docx</code> file is there for final-stage clean up and formatting. For example, if the journal requires double-spaced manuscripts, you can quickly double-space in Open Office or Microsoft Word. But don&#8217;t spend too much time formatting. Remember, it all gets stripped out when your manuscript goes to print. The time spent on needless formatting can be put to better use in polishing the prose of your draft.</p>

		<p>Nice article, but it looks like footnotes aren&#8217;t parsed. See e.g. &#8220;^[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/. Don't worry if you don't understand some of of this terminology yet!]&#8221; at the top of the article.</p>
<p>Also, as one of the maintainers of CSL, I&#8217;d like to point out that</p>
<p>&#8220;written in a “citation style language” (yet another plain-text convention, in this case for describing citation styles) and usually denoted by the .csl file extension. Luckily, there is an organization that maintains an archive of common citation styles, some even tailored for specific journals.&#8221;</p>
<p>could better be written as</p>

<p>We&#8217;d like to claim the term &#8220;Citation Style Language&#8221; as our own, and since we use it as a trademark it makes sense to capitalize it. CSL styles always have the .csl extension, we usually use the term &#8220;repository&#8221; to refer to our style archive, and the open source CSL project is very loosely organized, so it&#8217;s probably better to refer to it as a project.</p>
