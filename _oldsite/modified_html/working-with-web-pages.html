<h2>Lesson Goals</h2>
<p>This lesson introduces <span class="tech">Uniform Resource Locators</span> (URLs) and explains how to use Python to <span class="tech">download</span> and <span class="tech">save</span> the contents of a web page to your local hard drive.</p>
<h3>About URLs</h3>
<p>A <span class="tech">web page</span> is a file that is stored on another computer, a machine known as a <span class="tech">web server</span>. When you “go to” a web page, what is actually happening is that your computer, the <span class="tech">client</span>, sends a request to the server (the <span class="tech">host</span>) out over the network, and the server replies by sending a copy of the page back to your machine. One way to get to a web page with your browser is to follow a link from somewhere else. You also have the ability, of course, to paste or type a <span class="tech">Uniform Resource Locator</span> (URL) directly into your browser. The URL tells your browser where to find an online resource by specifying the server, directory and name of the file to be retrieved, as well as the kind of <span class="tech">protocol</span> that the server and your browser will agree to use while exchanging information (like HTTP, the <span class="tech">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</span>). The basic structure of a URL is</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">protocol://host:port/path?query</pre>
<p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>
<pre class="xml">http://oldbaileyonline.org</pre>
<p>The most basic kind of URL simply specifies the protocol and host. If you give this URL to your browser, it will return the main page of The <a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.oldbaileyonline.org']);" target="_blank"><span class="pub">Old Bailey Online</span></a> website. The default assumption is that the main page in a given directory will be named index, usually <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>The URL can also include an optional <span class="tech">port number</span>. Without getting into too much detail at this point, the network protocol that underlies the exchange of information on the Internet allows computers to connect in different ways. Port numbers are used to distinguish these different kinds of connection. Since the default port for HTTP is 80, the following URL is equivalent to the previous one.</p>
<pre class="xml">http://oldbaileyonline.org:80</pre>
<p>As you know, there are usually many web pages on a given website. These are stored in directories on the server, and you can specify the path to a particular page. The “About” page for <span class="pub">The Old Bailey Online</span> has the following URL.</p>
<pre class="xml">http://oldbaileyonline.org/static/Project.jsp</pre>
<p>Finally, some web pages allow you to enter queries. <span class="pub">The Old Bailey Online</span> website, for example, is laid out in such a way that you can request a particular page within it by using a <span class="tech">query string</span>. The following URL will take you to a search results page for criminal record trials containing the word “arsenic”.</p>
<pre class="xml">http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?form=custom&amp;_divs_fulltext=arsenic</pre>
<p>The snippet after the “<span class="reserved">?</span>” represents the query. You can learn more about building queries in <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/downloading-multiple-records-using-query-strings">Downloading Multiple Records Using Query Strings</a>.</p>
<h3>Opening URLs with Python</h3>
<p>As a digital historian you will often find yourself wanting to use data held in scholarly databases online. To get this data you could open URLs one at a time and copy and paste their contents to a text file, or you can use Python to automatically harvest and process webpages. To do this, you’re going to need to be able to open URLs with your own programs. The Python language includes a number of standard ways to do this.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s work with the kind of file that you might encounter while doing historical research. Say you’re interested in race relations in eighteenth century Britain. <a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.oldbaileyonline.org']);" target="_blank"><span class="pub">The Old Bailey Online</span></a> (OBO) is a rich resource that provides trial transcripts from 1674 to 1913 and is one good place to seek sources.</p>
<p><img alt="Old" class="wp-image-218" src="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/old-bailey.png" title="Old"/>
<p>The Old Bailey Online Homepage </p></p>
<p>For this example, we will be using the trial transcript of Benjamin Bowsey, a “black moor” who was convicted of breaking the peace during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Riots" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);" target="_blank">Gordon Riots</a> of 1780. The URL for the entry is</p>
<pre class="xml">http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t17800628-33&amp;div=t17800628-33</pre>
<p>By studying the URL we can learn a few things. First, The OBO is written in JSP (<span class="tech">JavaServer Pages</span>, a web programming language which outputs HTML), and it’s possible to retrieve individual trial entries by making use of the query string. Each is apparently given a unique ID number (<span class="var">id=t</span> in the URL), built from the date of the trial session in the format (<span class="var">YYYYMMDD</span>) and the trial number from within that court session, in this case: <span class="var">33</span>. If you change the two instances of <code>33</code> to <code>34</code> in your browser and press Enter, you should be taken to the next trial. Unfortunately, not all websites have such readable and reliable URLs.</p>

<p>Trial Transcript Page of Benjamin Bowsey, 1780.</p></p>
<p>Spend a few minutes looking at Benjamin Bowsey’s trial page. Here we are not so much interested in what the transcript says, but what features the page has. Notice the “<a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?foo=bar&amp;path=sessionsPapers/17800628.xml&amp;div=t17800628-33&amp;xml=yes" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.oldbaileyonline.org']);" target="_blank">View as XML</a>” link at the bottom that takes you to a heavily marked up version of the text which may be useful to certain types of research. You can look at a <a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/images.jsp?doc=178006280084" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.oldbaileyonline.org']);" target="_blank">scan of the original document</a>, which was transcribed to make this resource. And you can access a “<a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/print.jsp?div=t17800628-33" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.oldbaileyonline.org']);" target="_blank">Print-friendly version</a>” by clicking a link near the top of the entry.</p>
<p>When you are processing web resources automatically, it is often a good idea to work with printable versions if you can, as they tend to have less formatting. Since we have that option, we will use the printable version in this lesson.</p>
<pre class="xml">http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/print.jsp?div=t17800628-33</pre>
<p>Now let’s try opening the page using Python. Copy the following program into Komodo Edit and save it as <code>open-webpage.py</code>. When you execute the program, it will <span class="reserved">open</span> the trial file, <span class="reserved">read</span> its contents into a Python string called <span class="var">webContent</span> and then <span class="reserved">print</span> the first three hundred characters of the string to the “Command Output” pane. Use the <code>View -&gt; Web Developer -&gt; View Page Source</code> command in Firefox to verify that the HTML source of the page is the same as the source that your program retrieved. Each browser has a different shortcut key to open the page source. In Firefox on PC it is <code>CTRL+ u</code>. If you cannot find it on your browser, try using a search engine to find where it is. (See the Python library reference to learn more about <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-urllib2.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.python.org']);" target="_blank"><span class="literal">urllib2</span></a><a href="filename">.)</a></p>
<pre class="python"># open-webpage.py

import urllib2

url = 'http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/print.jsp?div=t17800628-33'

response = urllib2.urlopen(url)
webContent = response.read()

print webContent[0:300]
</pre>
<p>These five lines of code achieve an awful lot very quickly. Let us take a moment to make sure that everything is clear and that you can recognize the building blocks that allow us to make this program do what we want it to do.</p>
<p><span class="var">url</span>, <span class="var">response</span>, and <span class="var">webContent</span> are all variables that we have named ourselves.</p>
<p><span class="var">url</span> holds the URL of the web page that we want to download. In this case, it is the trial of Benjamin Bowsey.</p>
<p>On the following line, we call the function <span class="var">urlopen</span>, which is stored in a Python module named <code>urllib2.py</code>, and we have asked that function to open the website found at the URL we just specified. We then saved the result of that process into a variable named <span class="var">response</span>. That variable now contains an open version of the requested website.</p>
<p>We then use the <span class="reserved">read</span> method, which we used earlier, to copy the contents of that open webpage into a new variable named <span class="var">webContent</span>.</p>
<p>Make sure you can pick out the variables (there are 3 of them), the modules (1), the methods (2), and the parameters (1) before you move on.</p>
<p>In the resulting output, you will notice a little bit of HTML markup:</p>
<pre class="xml"> &lt;!-- MAIN CONTENT --&gt;

&lt;div id="main" class="full"&gt;&lt;div id="main2"&gt;
		&lt;div style="font-family:serif;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Old Bailey Proceedings Online&lt;/i&gt;
(www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 6.0, 16 March 2013),
June 1780, trial of
BENJAMIN                      BOWSEY
</pre>
<p>Because we are using the printable version there is a lot less than most web pages have, but there is still more than we need. Don’t worry; you will soon learn how to remove that excess markup.</p>
<h3>Saving a Local Copy of a Web Page</h3>
<p>Given what you already know about writing to files, it is quite easy to modify the above program so that it writes the contents of the <span class="var">webContent</span> string to a local file on our computer rather than to the “Command Output” pane. Copy the following program into Komodo Edit, save it as <code>save-webpage.py</code> and execute it. Using the <code>File -&gt; Open File</code> command in Firefox, open the file on your hard drive that it creates (<code>obo-t17800628-33.html</code>) to confirm that your saved copy is the same as the online copy.</p>
<pre class="python"># save-webpage.py

import urllib2

url = 'http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/print.jsp?div=t17800628-33'

response = urllib2.urlopen(url)
webContent = response.read()

f = open('obo-t17800628-33.html', 'w')
f.write(webContent)
f.close</pre>
<p>So, if you can save a single file this easily, could you write a program to download a bunch of files? Could you step through trial IDs, for example, and make your own copies of a whole bunch of them? Yep. We’ll get there soon.</p>
