This is obviously too much, not only from a computational perspective, but also because clustering algorithms such as k-means loose much of their power due to the so-called *curse of dimensionality*. We will thus need to significantly reduce the number of features. To do so, we first create a new instance of the `df_abstracts_tfidf` with reduced maximum features to 250. We also tell the model to only consider words from the vocabulary that appear in at least five different documents but not more than 100 times. We also add the possibility to not only include single words, but bigrams as well (such as \"19th century\"). Finally, we tell our model to get rid of any potential accents.\n",
