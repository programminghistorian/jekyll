0,Norwegian Muslims denouncing terrorism: beyond ‘moderate’ versus ‘radical’?,"In contemporary European societies, Muslims are often viewed through a binary frame of ‘moderate’ versus ‘radical’. This article aims to deconstruct the dichotomy of ‘moderate’ versus ‘radical’, and to explore how Muslims uphold, appropriate or subvert this binary frame. It takes up three case studies of public events organized in the city center of Oslo, Norway, by Muslims who wanted to make explicit statements against violence committed in the name of Islam. Based on participant observation, qualitative interviews with the organizers and a large collection of news reports and opinion pieces, the author demonstrates that these statements can be seen as a ‘multiple critique’: against terrorism, against stereotypical representations of Muslims and Islam, and (in some cases) also against the ‘moderate/radical’ dichotomy. This article critically addresses the pressure on Muslims to prove that they are peaceful and loyal citizens, and examines the relationship between the ‘Muslim Question’ and contestations about ‘true’ Islam.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2021.1865600,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
1,"A comparative analysis of three Sunni Muslim organizations on ‘moderate’ and ‘radical’ Islam in Egypt, Morocco and Indonesia","The distinction between ‘moderate’ and ‘radical’ Islam has played a key role in tackling contemporary militant religious extremism. This article examines three prominent Sunni Muslim institutions that uphold this distinction and present themselves as the peaceful and moderate voices of ‘true Islam’, namely al-Azhar al-Sharīf of Egypt, Nahdlatul Ulama of Indonesia and al-Rabita al-Muhammadiyya lil-‘Ulama’ of Morocco. The article provides a critical, comparative analysis of their religious discourses and theological strategies in developing an ‘exceptional’ and ‘moderate’ Sunni response to jihadist militancy, particularly after the emergence of the so-called ‘Islamic State’ in Syria and Iraq (IS). It demonstrates that each institution has developed its own brand of moderateness with different motivations, argumentations, content and religious justifications. As such, this article challenges the moderate-versus-radical dichotomy by revealing that there are multiple discourses on moderation, instead of it being one single and coherent moderate bloc.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1868383,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
2,Musical negotiations of a ‘moderate’ versus a ‘radical’ Islam in Morocco: dissonance and the sonic among vocal performers of Islam-inspired music,"This article explores how in Morocco, music is used to construct and subvert discourses on a ‘moderate’ vs. a ‘radical’ Islam. I focus on experiences and practices of vocal performers of Islam-inspired music, who operate in two different musical domains: state-sponsored stages for Sufi music, and non-state-sponsored stages for anashid – acapella Islamic songs, generally associated with more orthodox interpretations of Islam. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork among these artists, I analyze how the Moroccan response to the War on Terror, and concomitant perceptions of ‘radical’ versus ‘moderate’ Islam, affect the ways in which they present themselves and their music. I propose the notion of ‘dissonance’ to demonstrate how the artists’ musical practices, as well as their narratives of performance, ethics, and emotions converge with, yet simultaneously also rub against state discourses on a ‘moderate’ vs. a ‘radical’ Islam.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2021.1865602,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
3,Aesthetics of authority: ‘Islam Nusantara’ and Islamic ‘radicalism’ in Indonesian film and social media,"In Indonesia, Islamic ‘counter-terror culture’ contests Islamic ‘radicalization’. Indonesia’s largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), takes a leading role in initiating counter-terror culture. Central to their initiatives are ideas about ‘Islam Nusantara’ (Islam of the Archipelago). This article analyzes two NU initiatives: (1) the documentary Rahmat Islam Nusantara (2015), which challenges how ‘radical’ groups interpret the Quran, and (2) the ‘cyber warrior initiative’ in which volunteers contest ‘radicalism’ on social media. The article explores how these initiatives construct ‘counternarratives’ that frame Islam Nusantara as antidote against ‘radicalism’ and analyzes how, in doing so, these initiatives negotiate the binary frame between ‘moderate’ and ‘radical’ Islam. The article proposes that Rahmat Islam Nusantara and the cyber warriors uphold this binary frame and that meanwhile, these initiatives are marked by an aesthetics of authority, which constructs traditional figures of Islamic authority as role models who can help protect the country against radicalism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1868387,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
4,"Countering ‘Islamic’ violent extremism? The implementation of programs to prevent radicalization by Muslim-led civil society organizations in Malindi, Kenya","This article explores how Muslim-led civil society organizations (CSOs) implement programs to Counter Violent Extremism (CVE) in Malindi, Kenya, while adapting these programs to both their local context and the CVE-policies of Western donors. So far, little research has been done on how East-African Muslims relate themselves to (global) anxieties about Islam and violent extremism. Taking theories within the anthropology of secularism as an analytical frame, I argue that although Western donors try to maintain a public stance of neutrality towards different religions, they perpetuate stigmatizing associations between Islam and terrorism by tacitly mobilizing a distinction between ‘moderate’ and ‘radical’ Muslims. Based on extensive ethnographic research, I subsequently analyze how Muslim-led CSOs strategically navigate and challenge these stigmatizing associations as they implement CVE programs in Malindi. I also show how the desire to present Islam as peaceful limits possibilities to address widespread feelings of marginalization among Kenyan Muslims.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2021.1865603,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
5,Patriotic loyalty and interest representation among the Russian Islamic elite,"Two trends increasingly guiding the governance of Islam in Russia are political authoritarianisation and the global securitisation of Islam. Given that suspicions of loyalty so often configure in public discussions about Islam, Muslim leaders are compelled to continuously emphasise their patriotism. This article analyses recent mediated debates about Islam, in which the discursive boundary between ‘radical, non-traditional’ and ‘moderate, traditional’ Islam are being negotiated. The author argues that in the 2000s, the pressure to display loyalty has narrowed the scope of what is considered acceptable behaviour for Muslim leaders. Yet at the same time, these Muslim leaders cleverly adopt arguments and popular catchwords from the rhetoric of the political elite in order to emphasise the role of Islam in Russian society and tradition. In doing so, they seek to influence public discourse about Russian identity and defend the position of Muslims in the country.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2021.1865604,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
6,Development as a form of religious engineering? Religion and secularity in development discourse,"The burgeoning literature on religion and development tends to frame development as a project of post-WWII secular modernism and hence postulates a new ‘discovery of religions’ in development discourse. This perception is based on a two-fold forgetfulness of history. On the one hand, the colonial genealogy of development in the ‘civilising mission’ came with a decisive Christian input. On the other hand, the notion of secular modernism conceals the conceptual interconnectedness of religion and secularity in Western debates from the neoclassical secularization theories to the recent ‘return of God’ narratives. Drawing out the contours of a long history of international development, the article argues that scholarship needs to move beyond simple diagnoses of the presence or absence of religion in development discourse, but highlight how the ideology of development has tended to follow narratives about progress and values that are closely connected to discourses about global religion and secularity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1792049,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
7,"Engineering transformations in the ‘religion-development nexus’: Islamic law, reform, and reconstruction in Aceh","This article presents an exploration of the ways in which law, education, and religious propagation have been deployed as mutually reinforcing means for engineering social transformation in the Indonesian province of Aceh, and how these agendas were dramatically accelerated in the context of humanitarian and development interventions in post-conflict/post-disaster reconstruction. In doing so, it demonstrates and critically analyzes the ways in which contemporary Muslim visions of instrumentalist, future-oriented models of Islamic law have been formally implemented through the apparatus of the state as part of an over-arching project of engineering a new society, and of redefining conceptions of proper Islamic religious belief and practice. This case presents a striking instance of an agenda of religious revival envisioned not as an attempt to preserve or resuscitate established tradition, but rather as a tool in interventions for future-oriented projects for ‘improving’ the conditions of Muslims in both this world, and the next.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1792051,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
8,Engineering self and civil society: the promise of charity in Turkey,"In this article, I will show that charitable giving, along with charitable associations’ institutional practices, fashion moral, productive, and religious citizens through both intent and practice of giving. Thereby the individual donors and associations not only legitimize their aim of social transformation with reference to religious norms of giving, but at the same time also introduce new, professionalized (rationalized) forms to further develop, track, institutionalize and regulate these norms. If we define religious engineering as ‘active and conscious ways of working on the future shape of a given society’(cf. Spies and Schrode, Introduction), this article argues that the work of charitable associations and the processes of charitable giving in Turkey are practices of ‘religious engineering’ and should be analysed as such. I do this analysis through a direct focus on activities, ideas, and implementations of charitable associations and individuals.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1792052,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
9,"Becoming secular, yet remaining religious: the Gülen movement and the ‘engineering’ of the golden generation","In recent years there has been a religious turn in the development sector with the World Bank and national funding agencies in Europe and the US opening the space to Faith Based Organisations (FBOs). However, for some Islamic FBOs, this has not led to a comfortable assertion of their religious identity and mission on the world stage. Rather, in the post 9/11 environment, some Islamic FBOs have opted to develop an ‘invisible Islam’ wherein they background their religion through secularizing their language with a view to better integrating into the normative aid sector. Drawing on the work of Marie Juul Petersen and reflecting on the author’s own fieldwork on the Gülen Movement (GM), this paper will unpack this development. In doing so, it will highlight that the practice by GM is only a semantic exercise to cover its ongoing religious mission on account of continued hostility towards Islamic actors.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1792054,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
10,The gospel of prosperity and its concept of development: A Ghanaian Pentecostal-Charismatic experience,"The prosperity gospel, a doctrine in the global Pentecostal-Charismatic movement, characteristically demonstrates the nexus of the Christian faith and wealth. This article analyses Mensa Otabil, a Ghanaian prosperity preacher’s ‘20-year personal development plan’ for members of his church, the International Central Gospel Church (ICGC). It explores whether or not, why and how the members are aligning their lives and visions to his vision of how to achieve a better, prosperous community. Using ethnographic data obtained from selected members of the ICGC, this article investigates the idea and the implementation of the development plan, in order to understand the plan as Otabil’s conscious effort to change society through the transformation of individuals. It argues that Otabil’s efforts can be analysed as a form of religious engineering, where, the individual members are invited to act as engineers of their own life and subjectivity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1792050,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
11,Religions and development: a paradigm shift or business as usual?,"There has been a ‘turn to religion’ by global development actors over the past couple of decades. This article examines the extent to which this is evidence of a paradigm shift or simply business as usual. The first part of the article will examine the nature of this ‘turn to religion’, including how it has been debated and conceptualized within academic research. I examine the usefulness of the concept of ‘religious engineering’ (the focus of this thematic issue) as a way of helping us broaden approaches to the ‘religion-development nexus’ beyond a focus on the relationship between formal international FBOs and secular global development institutions. The second part of the article develops the concept of ‘religious engineering’ with reference to the work of Pierre Bourdieu. I argue that the concepts of habitus, field and capital help de-centre the focus of attention from global development institutions to other fields of religion-development intersection.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1792055,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-51
12,"Hidden presence: race and/in the history, construct, and study of western esotericism","Except for a few studies that explore the intersections between esoteric ideas/practices and white supremacy, race has largely been ignored in the field of Western esotericism. This article seeks to partake in remedying this lacuna. To do so, it provides a deconstructive analysis of the way race has operated in the field. I argue that race, although consistently overlooked, has functioned as a ‘hidden presence’ that has shaped both the historical formation of the field and the construct of Western esotericism – so much so, in fact, that we may conceive it as a subtext in and for the dominant ‘grand narrative’ of Western esotericism. In conclusion, I investigate recent attempts to omit ‘Western’ as a definitive adjective in the study of esotericism, thereby proposing that, even as we move ‘beyond the West,’ we must also continue to investigate the entanglements of ‘Western’ and whiteness.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1642262,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
13,Pentecosmopolis: on the pentecostal cosmopolitanism of Lagos,"Based on ethnography conducted in Lagos, one of the foremost pentecostal cities in the world, this article coins the interconnected concepts of ‘Pentecosmopolis’ and ‘pentecosmopolitanism’ to account for forms of cosmopolitanism that are shaped at the intersection of Pentecostalisms and urbanisms. These concepts highlight the dialectical role of Pentecostalisms in the cosmopolitization of urban sociospatialities, and of urbanisms in the cosmopolitization of Pentecostalisms. This article disbands the ideas of Pentecosmopolis and pentecosmopolitanism into two interconnected sub-concepts of ‘pentecosmopolitan spatiality’ and ‘pentecosmopolitan sociality’––of ‘pentecosmopolitan sociospatiality’. Against the background of marginality in scholarship, I examine the cosmopolitization—the diversification and contrastification—of sociospatial symbolisms, practices and relationalities taking shape in the city at the behest of Pentecostalisms, and in Pentecostalisms at the behest of the city.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1650308,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
14,Imagining Buddhist modernism: the shared religious categories of scholars and American Buddhists,"Scholarship on religion has often centered on the gaps between academic analysis and the self-understanding of religious people. In the study of Buddhism in America, however, many scholars and practitioners share cultural histories, material circumstances, and textual space. This article examines the nature of the relationship between particular academics and particular convert Buddhists to argue that they share a way of thinking about religion: perceiving a strong dichotomy between modernity and tradition, and a resulting willingness to take Buddhist modernist narratives at face value as descriptions of religious life. This normative modernism, along with reactions against it, leads to the collapse of descriptive and prescriptive discourse on American Buddhism. By contrast, scholarship that does not participate in the dichotomy between modern and traditional religion reveals a much richer, messier, and more accurate picture of Buddhism in America, and the Buddhists whose practices and self-representations exceed the boundaries of modernism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1664674,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
15,Religion and space in colonial South America: a technology of geo-political rule and terrestrial-spatial subjectivity in the Jesuit missions of the Banda Oriental,"Based on a genealogical analysis of documentary evidence, this paper explores the comprehensive technology of geo-political rule that was applied in the missions established and governed by the Society of Jesus in the territories of the Banda Oriental in South America, from the early 17th century to the second half of the 18th century. The interdependent knowledges and practices of the technology – its contested logics of universal conversion, its hard and soft geo-political techniques, its terrestrial-spatial subjectivities – as well as the resistances that opposed the technology’s operation are discussed and conceptualized. These conceptualizations are presented as contributions to the studies on colonial religious governmentalities. The conclusions highlight the relevance of governmentality approaches and meta-institutional analytical perspectives for the study of religions and space and religious geo-politics in past and contemporary societies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1709580,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
16,"Big Gods, socio-cultural evolution and the non-obvious merits of a sociological interpretation","Much of the recent, renewed interest in the cultural evolution of religion has been driven by findings in experimental and cognitive psychology, and, as a result of disciplinary boundaries, sociologists have engaged very little with this new data and theory. In order to bring sociology formally back into this discussion, we provide in this paper five sociological sources for the birth and diffusion of ‘Big God’ ideation (with monotheism serving as a paradigmatic case). Agentically, we suggest that Big God beliefs assuaged existential anxiety, aided in elite legitimation and were useful for religious entrepreneurs hoping to establish new institutional fields. Structurally, we suggest that Big God beliefs may have been an epiphenomenal attempt by people to symbolically represent the centralization of political authority and the intensified use of new technologies. We conclude with a general theory of the cultural evolution of Big Gods that integrates these agentic and structural explanations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1712666,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
17,Making sense of the study of spirituality: late modernity on trial,"In this article I offer a meta-theoretical mapping of spirituality studies and its many controversies. I begin by distinguishing between two projects that together constitute the field: the study for and the study of spirituality. I argue a good deal of the confusion surrounding ‘spirituality’ is the result of scholars failing to make this distinction. Next, I outline the few areas of agreement within the study of spirituality in order to illuminate what I consider the issue that defines the field: the merits and shortcomings of late modernity. By late modernity I mean the current era, whose origins can be traced roughly to the 1960s. I then offer a meta-theoretical analysis of the social-cum-political theoretical frameworks commonly used to study spirituality, delineating them according to their assessments of the contemporary epoch. I contend this is a useful and much-needed means of dispelling some of the fuzziness that characterizes the field.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1758229,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
18,‘Just leave it blank’ non-religious children and their negotiation of prayer in school,"This article examines how non-religious children experience acts of collective worship and prayer in primary school settings and analyses how they negotiate religion and their non-religious identities in these events. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork examining non-religious childhoods and collective worship in three English primary schools, the authors explore how non-religious children demonstrate their agency when confronted with particular boundaries and concepts related to religion and non-religion in school contexts. Attending to the experiences, perspectives, and practices of non-religious children adds to our understanding of the varieties of non-religion, which has to date largely focused on elite, adult populations. Focusing on non-religious children’s experiences of prayer reveals how these children did not experience tensions between praying to God and their non-religious identities and articulated their own interpretations of these practices, deepening understanding of the lived realities of non-religious cultures and identities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1758230,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
19,Vocation for travel. Catholic priestly training in Sri Lanka,"Catholic priests and advanced seminarians in Sri Lanka often describe their entrance to the seminary as the response to a strong spiritual calling that they could not ignore. Young seminarians offer more ambiguous narratives, where a combination of material anxieties, local cultural traditions and individual aspirations, encourage them to consider joining the clergy. This article examines how seminaries highlight aspects of religious formation where vocational discernment and the authenticity of one's calling are left for later stages of formation. Emphasizing aspects of career mobility, graduate studies overseas and missionary work, seminaries provide an attractive alternative for prospective priests in Sri Lanka. I argue that there is no contradiction between the spiritual dimensions of religious vocation and the material aspirations of seminarians. Although ethical dispositions emerge and replace the mundane impulses that initially attract young men to the seminary, material incentives are never completely eliminated from the vocational map of seminarians.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1810818,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
20,Why Durkheim really thought that Buddhism was a ‘religion’ (in memoriam Massimo Rosati),"In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, and in ‘On the Definition of Religious Phenomena,' Durkheim famously asserted both that Buddhism was a ‘religion' and an ‘atheistic' one at that. Why he did so is a problem long-considered settled. Of two possible answers, one is commonplace, while the other is uncommon and consequential. I shall attempt to explicate Durkheim's uncommon and far- reaching, but overlooked, reasons for declaring atheistic Buddhism a ‘religion.' This essay concurs with Martin Southwold that Durkheim believed – wrongly – that religion was ‘monothetic' class, when, in fact, it was ‘polythetic.' In order to admit Buddhism as a ‘religion,' Durkheim discovered that he had to apply different criteria for defining Buddhism as ‘religion’ than to theistic religions. Buddhism did not radiate dynamogenic force or induce a sense of existential dependence. Buddhism was a religion because it was an agent in making a meaningful life.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1761004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
21,Pushing Pentecostalism toward the respectable: on the mainstreaming of a countercultural religious movement in Chile,"Pentecostalism used to be the stigmatized religion of the marginal sectors of Chilean society and has often been interpreted by scholars in terms of symbolic protest. However, a new generation of Pentecostals is now attempting to redefine their religion as more legitimate and respectable. This process involves attempts at gaining more public recognition and it implies revisiting Pentecostal stylistic and religious practices. Many younger Pentecostals tend to distance themselves, both from certain kinds of emotional expressions and from what they perceive as the rigid formalism of classical Pentecostalism. This is prevalent, both in Pentecostal worship which carefully balances effusiveness and liveliness with control, and in testimonies of younger Pentecostals who tend to downplay the sensationalist aspects of conversion (as caused by an instant revelation) and rather portray it as a gradual process of maturation. My paper explores how mainstreaming processes unfold at different levels and occasionally cause tensions among Chilean Pentecostals.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1712054,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
22,"The deliverance of the administrative state: deep state conspiracism, charismatic demonology, and the post-truth politics of American Christian nationalism","This article uses discourse analysis to explore the intersection of spiritual warfare demonology and Christian nationalism among Trump-supporting neo-charismatic evangelicals. Analysing public materials produced during and after the 2016 US presidential campaign, it demonstrates how demonologies operate discursively to categorise, comprehend, and contest understandings of American identity and destiny. Situating spiritual warfare demonology in relation to narratives of ‘post-truth politics’ as the destabilisation of neoliberal consensus reality, the article explores how charismatic evangelicals position Trump’s election as a divine assault on a demoniac status quo, epitomised in the conspiratorial figure of the ‘Deep State.’ Examining demonologies of the ‘state’ and ‘border’ as joint arenas of epistemic and societal contestation, the article shows how spiritual warfare discourses seek to (re)define sociocultural notions of truth and falsity and thereby (de)legitimise specific gendered, sexualised, and racialised forms of being and belonging.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1810817,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
23,Interreligious dialogue groups and the mass media,"Interreligious dialogues have received attention since they were introduced as a security policy and social pacification measure after the attack on 9/11. This essay examines the development of interreligious dialogue in Germany as well as the influence of media discourses on interreligious dialogue and asks to what extent they affect the motives, goals and modes of communication of both Muslim and non-Muslim participants. This analysis leads to the thesis that the mass media’s frequent security-policy framing of Islam within issues of integration, violence, and threat has developed interreligious dialogue groups as a space of face-to-face coping processes with the imagined religious conflict. Muslims attend it in order to put Islam in a different and positive frame. For the Christian participants this also presents the opportunity to reach a new relevance of religion in the public secular space.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1754604,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
24,‘Dear Hindu Friends’: official Diwali greetings as a medium for diplomatic dialogue,"This article discusses greeting messages as a genre of interreligious communication. Greeting messages are defined as official communication issued by religious institutions and addressed to the members of another religious community on the occasion of specific feast days or anniversaries. Drawing on the insights of politolinguistic analysis, this article treats these messages primarily as a form of public diplomacy. The case study analyses the messages issued on the occasion of the Hindu festival Diwali/Deepavali by the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and World Council of Churches between 2015 and 2017. Distributed through the social media and posted on the institutional websites, the Diwali messages seek to speak as a Christian voice to all Hindus. Beyond the official addressee, the messages also potentially face the scrutiny of the global public sphere, especially an internal Christian readership. This article analyses what language strategies are used to deal with these varied demands.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1754599,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
25,Guestbooks in multifaith spaces as (inter-)religious media,"In recent years, various forms of multifaith spaces have been emerging in Germany which include so-called Rooms of Silence in hospitals or educational institutions as well as Gardens of Religions. So far, empirical research on these spaces has focused on their establishment or their functions within the surrounding organisations. In this article we will put a focus on the ‘user experience’ of multifaith spaces based on an analysis of guestbooks. These books are a unique source of data for a qualitative in-depth analysis as they offer an opportunity for visitors for commentary including religious references and speech acts. Drawing on two case studies from a Room of Silence within a hospital and a Garden of Religions, we investigate how users experience and appropriate multifaith spaces and how guestbooks may become media of (inter-) religious contact.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1756068,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
26,The big friendly counter-space? Interreligious encounter within social media,"Research on interreligious dialogue mostly focuses on face-to-face meetings, however, it also takes place in other contexts. Among them is the huge space of interactive media, where adherents of different religious traditions meet, e.g., in interreligious groups on Facebook, boards or commentary sections – but so far little has been researched on this field. The article is an explorative attempt to sort the field of interreligious dialogue and encounter in social media, drawing on a comparative perspective on the field of offline interreligious dialogue. For this purpose, it first gives a systematizing overview of the existing research on interreligious encounter in social media as well as on (offline) interreligious dialogue, identifying key questions and issues on interreligious encounter. Examples from different social media platforms then allow conclusions about commonalities and differences between online and offline interreligious encounter and suggest crucial aspects to follow up on in future research on this field.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1754605,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
27,"Me, myself and the other. Interreligious and intrareligious relations in neo-conservative online forums","The Internet can be a place for exchange, but also foster echo chambers of closed world views. This poses interesting questions for the possibility of interreligious dialogue online. The article examines the cases of German Evangelical and Salafist Internet forums which mainly target a specific religious denomination, but nevertheless provide spaces for contact between different religions and denominations. For the study, a combination of quantitative and qualitative text analysis is applied. Quantitative analysis makes it possible to gain an overview of the discussed themes from a large body of text and serves as a basis for sampling smaller textual units for close examination using qualitative content analysis. The analysis yields two primary results: First, intrareligious dialogue plays a particular role for the negotiation of religious identity. Second, interreligious relations reflect the societal positions of both religious groups.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1754603,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
28,The space between us: considering online media for interreligious dialogue,"The internet has been conceptualized as a public sphere in which constructive dialogues – such as inter-religious dialogues – can occur. Public spheres, however, require reason, reflectivity and sincerity rarely found in most web spaces. Therefore, this approach might be counterproductive. Instead, I suggest we consider online communication as a Foucauldian discourse, a site of struggle, in which norms and concepts are negotiated. This chapter considers a few theoretical frameworks that allow researchers to critically survey online inter-religious dialogue. Four case studies are then reviewed in light of these theoretical considerations. The chapter argues that online discourses need to be examined by paying attention to the technological affordances, the social and cultural context, and the linguistic strategies employed. It is suggested that, for interreligious dialogue to happen, it needs to carve out a space within this online media that is dedicated to contemplation and openness.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1754598,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
29,"Resistance through secrecy and integration: Pueblo Indians, Catholicism, and the subversion of colonial authority","While the most well know example of indigenous resistance to colonialism in North America is the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, this overt form of resistance is one event in a longer history of Pueblo people’s struggles to maintain their religious traditions in the face of colonialism. More consistently has been the use of covert tactics of secrecy and the strategic integration of Catholicism in ways that subtly subverted colonial hegemony. This article begins with a discussion of a framework for understanding Pueblo ‘religion,’ then examines the Pueblo Indian Patron Saint Feast Days as expressions of religious agency through their intentional incorporation of Catholicism on the Pueblos’ own terms. It then explores how this came to be through an examination of Spanish colonial and missionary ideologies and practices that influenced the development of secrecy and religious adaptation as successful subtle forms of subversion that later became articulated within the Feast Days.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1713514,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
30,Divine servitude against the work of man: dispossessive subjects and Exoduses to and from property,"The self-possessive individual of early modern colonial capitalism depended upon a limit to the self’s alienability: while one could buy and sell other humans, one could not sell or enslave oneself. This essay explores how liberal political philosophers and abolitionist hermeneuts managed Biblical sanction for voluntary enslavement (contained in Exodus 21) in order to ground and normalize liberal-capitalist institutions, such as private property and wage labor. It then shifts to an archive of black ex-slave spiritual autobiography, exploring how former slaves figured their becoming mundanely free as becoming God’s possession. Refusing liberal self-possession, these once-possessed, dispossessive subjects articulate a general critique of property relations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1713515,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
31,Subversive space: representations of space as articulations of sovereignty in colonial Mysore,"This article is an inquiry into the relationship between representations of space and religion, power, and territory. It argues that the manner that space is represented is intimately tied to the colonial project as the tool through which European nations could represent the world they wanted, promulgating a specific religious perspective and articulating colonizers’ desired spatial, religious, and political order. This is contrasted with a set of murals that visualize an alternative perspective of space and territory found in the citramaṇṭapa of the Vēṅkaṭaramanasvāmi temple in Mysore. These murals that depict space differently contested the colonial hegemony of space by articulating an indigenous spatial order constructed upon an alternate cosmological and religious model, thereby subtly subverting colonialism by articulating India as a sacred and sovereign domain.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1713516,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50

Originating from Minangkabau, West Sumatra – the world's largest Muslim matrilineal society – exposed Adam to a hybrid upbringing of traditional home vis-a-vis localised progressive arts education combining Islamic teaching and Western-influenced artistic articulation. Her trajectory shows a woman's dancing body as paradoxical cultural processess, e.g., an interweaving of multiple discourses of Islam, matriliny, and modernism, informed by the innate resilience of Minangkabau culture in defending its core traits against the colonial powers.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1713517,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
33,"European perceptions of religion and society in 18th-century China & Bengal, and their subverted gaze in local art and encounter","This essay presents two late 18th century European travelers’ encounters with and perceptions of religion in Chinese and Indian societies. While C.L.J De Guignes made an extensive tour of Chinese pagodas, Balthazar Solvyns was depicting Bengali people in 1794. Both traveler's works reveal a lineage of ideas involving exoticism and early-modern orientalism. While creating images of religion based on superstition and alterity, they did not take into account how the gaze was reversed unto them. While Solvyns created images of ‘the Hindoos’, Bengali artists were depicting the European colonial presence in scroll paintings and temple sculptures. These depictions may be considered as mimetic practices subverting the relational gaze, incorporating the European presence in order to overcome it. Contrasting early ethnographical European descriptions of Asian religions with their original contexts, a subverted gaze shines back upon the self-image of early modern European scholars seeking to make exotic Asian religions ‘known’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2020.1713518,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
34,Religion: the first ten years,"The journal Religion was founded as a joint enterprise by a group of scholars in the north of Great Britain who shared an interest in the study of religions as an enterprise independent of Christian theological viewpoints. Here the founding moments of the journal are recalled by one of the participants in its genesis and immediate development, and the first ten years (1971–1981) are briefly reviewed. A significant intersection with the thirteenth quinquennial congress of the International Association for the History of Religions (IAHR) is also noted.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1686825,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50

36,Psychology of religion(s) and religious studies: into the future,"This article focuses on three ‘liminal’ issues at the confluence of the study of religions and the psychology of religion. These are cross-disciplinary interconnections, responses to societal challenges and research methodology.

37,Bridging the gaps: a better future for the study of religion,"A better future for the study of religion would incorporate innovative and engaging approaches to bridge the gaps between popular and scholarly understandings of what comprises religion and why it remains relevant and significant in our world. This article calls for studying religion in a manner that emphasizes how it is thoroughly enmeshed with other ways of acting and existing in the world. The study of religion appears here as the study of how people attribute certain things as special, powerful, and authoritative, which conveys much about how people construct and manage social and cultural forms more generally. We argue that religion matters not because it supposedly represents a unique, autonomous realm of life, but rather because its workings are related to and paradigmatic for many other forms of human behavior.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681082,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
38,"Already there: categories, formations, and circulations in the future of the study of religion","Like music, the study of religion moves into the future through decoration, development and transformation of what is already there. The future of the study of religion, which is already present in recent research on material religion, lies in the modulation of basic categories, the reconfiguration of contexts as formations, and the tracking of religion-like circulations through many fields. This essay highlights recent publications that exemplify these transformations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681084,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
39,Towards increasing diversity in the study of religion,"The study of religion needs to be enriched by more diverse voices. The author argues that some progress has been made, but more needs to be done, particularly through collaborating with those most frequently muted. The challenge is to not simply to include those outside the traditional bastions of white, male privilege in the global north, but to actively widen the current reach to make an impact on how knowledge is actually created and shared. Initiatives such as liberating and de-colonizing the curriculum are discussed, with particular reference to the study of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681086,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
40,The current Conflict of the Faculties and the future of the study of religion/s,"The future of the study of religion/s cannot be aptly discussed without considering the future of all academic studies (the humanities, social and natural sciences). Based on my experience as a board member of the Science Council of Japan, I argue that there are two major urgent challenges that are shared by, but not unique to, academic studies conducted in Japan: namely, how and to what degree to meet demands for social relevance; and what to do with the Euro-Western model of modern sciences. I will focus on the former, which stems from the relationships between scholarship and state governance. Scholars of religion/s may miss opportunities to contribute to interdisciplinary debates if they continue identifying applied studies primarily with theology or interfaith enterprises, while being satisfied with neo-empiricism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681095,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50

It stresses the comparative and multidisciplinary outlook of the discipline and its openness to new perspectives, theories and themes as criteria for future success.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681097,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
42,Political and economic pressures on the study of religions: current trends and future prospects in the Danish context,"The future of the study of religions is, like any other academic discipline, dependent on political and economic factors. In a country such as Denmark, where universities are primarily financed by the state, the willingness of the state to fund disciplines in the humanities impacts the future of the study of religions. The transition to a competition state has entailed the introduction of austerity measures and reforms that have a considerable impact on the study of religions. Nevertheless, the requirement that teachers in secondary education who teach classes on religion have a relevant university degree will guarantee the survival of the discipline. The article concludes by extrapolating current trends into the future. Tightened budgets will impact the study of religions, with potential consequences such as a greater pressure on researchers to compete for external funding and a need to reduce staff.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681099,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
43,Imagining the future study of religion and spirituality,"Having learned many useful lessons from the movement of deconstruction over the previous decades, it is high time for our discipline to move forward and begin reconstructing the study of religion as a whole on new and better foundations. If we want to have our voices heard and have an impact on the wider public debate instead of being marginalized and defunded as irrelevant, we need a positive and convincing, even inspiring new narrative about religion that demonstrates its great importance not just to societal but to general human concerns. The article outlines one possible direction for such a new narrative, focusing on the key terms ‘experience,’ ‘consciousness,’ ‘imagination,’ and ‘spirituality.’ Far from implying a new kind of religionism along the lines of the Eranos or Eliade schools, this means that we should move such topics out of the taboo sphere for secular scholars and reclaim them for critical non-religionist methods and approaches.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681103,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
44,Modest reflections on the ambiguous future of the study of religion(s),Reflection on the future study of religion(s) poses three questions: What is the definition of religion? What should ‘study’ mean in the academic discourse about religion? And how about its future as an independent discipline within the humanities? The first question brings about a critique of the conceptual definition of religion and the true purpose of the study of religion(s) in wholistic human formation. The second suggests a departure from the monotone of a European and North American model of ‘study.’ And the third encourages self-conscious and tolerance of the ambiguous and ambivalent identity of the study and moving towards more active engagements in the era of the 4IR.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681104,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
45,Back to the land and waters: futures for the study of religions,"In this reflection, I consider how paying attention to the grounds of our research, literally, affords the study of religion an opportunity to return to its roots as a discipline that thinks seriously about how what we call religion is connected to what we call nature. I ask what scholars of religion can learn from the 21st century movement of Indigenous Water Protectors, reading their invocations to ‘protect the sacred’ alongside earlier classic approaches in the study of religion and nature, such as those of David Hume and Jonathan Z. Smith. I close by briefly laying out five grounds for research in the study of religion, including positionality and land-based approaches.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681106,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
46,Relational religion: manifesto for a synthesis in the study of religion,"Religious traditions – although socially constructed – are distinguishable as distinct, practiced entities having pragmatic effects. Religion is not a purely scholarly invention. Correspondencies between empirical data and scientific concepts, or, between object language and metalanguage, have to be found beyond essentialism and reification. Consequently, there is a shift in parts of the study of religion towards approaches that counteract essentialism and reification by explaining subject-matters through relationality. A relational paradigm is beyond the alternative of a naïve realism and positivism on the one hand or a radical constructivism or deconstructivism on the other hand. Against this background, the article draws attention to relations in the study of religion, especially between cognition, experience, action, and materiality, between semantics and social structure, and between structure and process. The article argues for a synthesis of different approaches in the study of religion, namely cognitive and material approaches, and experience- and action-orientated theories and methodologies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1686847,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
47,Future of religious studies,"As an academic community, religious studies scholars and educators are facing a significant challenge. In part, that challenge connects with challenges to the humanities more broadly. However, religious studies is not the humanities; many of us draw on social sciences or natural sciences methodology, and some of us are involved in multi- or interdisciplinary research. Our problem is much bigger than the crisis in the humanities. Religious studies as a field is ill-prepared to adjust to the shifts in academic, social, economic, political, and global landscapes currently underway. The future of religious studies depends on our ability to recognize and adapt to these shifts. Religious studies will advance (or falter) on these four fronts: research publication, student education, institutional relations, and public engagement.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681121,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
48,Remapping our mindset: towards a transregional and pluralistic outlook,"The future of the study of religion/s must be actively envisioned and pursued. In the aftermath of the deconstruction of ‘religion’ and the idea of ‘secularization’ as imbued with a Western teleology, it is necessary to rethink and reconfigure the study of religion/s against a global horizon. In this essay I propose that we should move out of the unproductive Religious Studies-Theology binary and frame our work in the midst of the humanities. A new mindset is needed for scholarly research on religion, and to achieve this I point at the new vistas arising from a transregional and pluralistic outlook.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681122,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
49,Four conjectures on the future of the study of religion/s: a plea for further differentiation of the discipline,"In this contribution, I argue that a stronger division of labor within the non-confessional academic study of religion/s would help the discipline to thrive. A further differentiation between Theory of Religion, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science is called for. I am convinced that this division would help scholars to cope with the permanent and fundamental challenges of the discipline, two of which are most noteworthy: the disputed epistemic status of the object ‘religion,’ and the question of normativity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1684743,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
50,‘What’s in a name?’: the case for ‘Study of Religions’,"This article makes the case for adopting ‘Study of Religions’ as a single common disciplinary name for cross-cultural, comparative and theoretical studies of ‘religion/s’. I argue that the grammatical and substantive format of this name adequately addresses disciplinary requirements and resolves a longstanding debate in the field. It also supplies a distinctive, recognizable international brand. While poststructuralist and deconstructionist work in the field has been stimulating, it has not fostered positive disciplinary identification. Adoption of a single name will promote centripetal drive and theoretical coherence which is where the most effective work in the Study of Religions has been done since the 1960s – and continues.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1685181,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
51,From religious studies to worldview studies,"This essay uses the ‘big questions’ embedded in ways of life and implicitly answered in goal directed action to address the future of the study of religion. It locates Religious Studies as a subset of Worldview Studies, defined in terms of big questions, in order to offer an evenhanded basis for comparing religious and nonreligious worldviews. Defining worldviews in terms of big questions highlights the evolved world-making capacities we share with other animals and upends the top-down approach that privileges systematized worldviews. An evolutionary perspective not only links the humanities and the sciences, but also suggests the priority of the nonreflective answers to big questions embedded in lived worldviews and ways of life. It presupposes a critical realist ontology, which embeds constructivism within a naturalistic perspective, and enables a variety of accounts of why things are the way they are that can be grounded (at least distally) in evolutionary theory.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681124,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
52,Studying religion in the pluriversity: decolonial perspectives,"Taking up the concept of the pluriversity as developed by mostly South American thinkers, this essay shares some thoughts about what the study of religion/s might look like if we seriously engage with questions of decolonisation. Building on the critique of the dominant Western, Eurocentric, colonialist and racialised models of thought that have historically shaped the field, I make a constructive proposal for an approach to the study of religion/s that centres around three Ps: a commitment to Pluriversality, an acknowledgment of Partiality, and a commitment to Participatory work. I illustrate this with some specific examples from studying religion in contemporary African contexts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1681108,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-50
53,"A brilliant jewel: sex, celibacy, and the Roman Catholic Church","As clerical sexual abuse scandals hit the news and the crisis of vocations worsens each year, debate about the merits of mandatory clerical celibacy continues to grow. The fact remains, however, that supposedly celibate priests have been sexually active in significant numbers throughout history and that their sexual activity has barely affected the power of the Church. In this article, I focus on the ‘everyday’ nature of sexual ‘incontinence’ among a group of Northeast Brazilian priests and analyse the relative systematicity with which vow-breaking is accommodated. Such systematicity, I suggest, reveals an ongoing stable-instability at the heart of the Church as an institution; a dynamic which, if better understood, can help to explain the most characteristic (but often overlooked) feature of institutions more generally: their impressive longevity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1525774,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
54,"From, into, and back: translations of the Sami words noaidi and noaidevuohta in context","This article discusses how the Sami word noaidi and the word for the noaidi’s trade (noaidevuohta) have been translated in missionary texts and academic research. It traces context-related translations of these Sami concepts: first by clergy into terms connoted to ‘witchcraft’ and ‘sorcery’, then by scholars into the technical terms ‘shaman’ and ‘shamanism’, and finally by contemporary scholars by translating them back into indigenous terms. The article is divided into three parts that explore changes in translations of noaidi and noaidevuohta from three slightly differing perspectives: the translations from Sami to other languages, the translations of the Bible into Sami languages, and the academic practice of translating technical terms back to Sami. These changes open a window into the research history of Sami religion and the power asymmetries between the Sami and majority cultures: through this window one sees that translations are situated, context-bound, and laden with implicit assumptions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1505673,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
55,"Pentecostalism, economics, capitalism: putting the Protestant Ethic to work","In recent years, academic interest in the nexus between Pentecostalism, economics, and capitalism has grown significantly. Notably, the vast majority of publications that have addressed this interface are to some degree conceptually framed by Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. In this article I consider what The Protestant Ethic might contribute to our understanding of the relationship between Pentecostalism and capitalism. First, I assess a particularly noteworthy attempt to draw Pentecostalism into Weber's genealogical account which draws a series of parallels between Pentecostalism and ascetic Protestantism. Second, I discuss the merits of an approach that is not primarily genealogical but remains indebted to the concepts that Weber introduces, elaborating a new affinity between Pentecostalism and capitalism in its present iteration. With this article, I seek to comprehensively extend the scope and sharpen the conceptual underpinnings of future analysis and empirical work in this area.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1573767,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
56,"Cross(ing) the peace walls in West Belfast: imitation, exemplarity, and divine power","This article examines a series of spatial practices called ‘cross walks’ and ‘cross vigils’ undertaken by a Pentecostal Christian church in West Belfast, Northern Ireland. It discusses the ways in which cross walk and vigil participants used imitative practices to bring divine power to bear on the urban spaces and place-specific issues of the church's local area. The article begins by discussing the church itself, and the ways in which participants understand themselves as situated within the ethno-political designations of ‘Protestant’ and ‘Catholic’ in Northern Ireland. It studies the various exemplars set up for the spatial practices in official discourse, and the ways in which these exemplars created a gendered narrative. Finally, it examines the links to Northern Ireland's parading tradition and the church pastor's suggested response to a local dispute over parade routes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1573768,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
57,"‘Stay up during the night, except for a little’ (Q 73:2): the qurʾānic vigils as ascetic training programs","In the field of history of religion, the Qurʾān and early Islam often seem to be ignored in discussions of asceticism and cultural evolution. With the usage of Peter Sloterdijk’s definition of áskēsis as ‘training’, this article proposes a new way to understand the qurʾānic attitude(s) to ascetic practices. By seeing the text’s articulations of vigils as two types of ascetic training programs, I argue that a hypothetical chronological development of the vigils takes place, and that this development illustrates a shift from the Prophet’s own extraordinary ‘improvement’ to a more general ‘maintenance’ practice for the ordinary believer. That the Qurʾān calls the believers to participate in such training programs may also explain the text’s divergent approach to other religious traditions’ ascetic practices. Through Sloterdijk’s definition of asceticism, it is made clear that the Qurʾān in its own way partakes in and negotiates the overarching ascetic tendency of its time.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1578295,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
58,The promise of the universal: non-Buddhists’ accounts of their Vipassanā meditation retreat experiences,"Since the 1970s non-Buddhist Westerners have been writing detailed descriptions of their personal experiences in vipassanā meditation retreat settings. These memoirs illustrate that meditation is positioned as a universal practice that is constructed as objective and empirically valid, but at the same time must be enacted within particular spaces, cosmologies, and socio-cultural contexts. To illustrate this relationship between the universal and particular, this article analyzes ten vipassanā meditation memoirs by non- Buddhists, an early group of memoirs from the 1960s and 1970s and more contemporary ones from 2011 to 2015. During this time, the meditation retreat has been experienced in multiple contexts, but non-Buddhists’ engagement with meditation consistently results in their judgment that the practice is universal enough. These non-Buddhist evaluations of the universal are further decoded within the Buddhist tradition and in comparison with critical theorists of modernity in order to recognize that universals are always manifest within particular contexts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1584130,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
59,"The Buddha was a devoted nationalist: Buddhist nationalism, ressentiment, and defending Buddhism in Myanmar","Since 2012, Buddhist nationalist movements – especially the 969 movement and Ma Ba Tha – have emerged in Burma/Myanmar seeking to defend Buddhism against mainly the Muslim minority, with monks delivering nationalist anti-Muslim sermons to huge audiences. The aim of this article is to demonstrate how a discriminatory nationalist agenda can – by appealing to the common trope of Buddhism-in-danger – appear to be justified to Buddhists. Based mainly on nationalist sermons, as well as on fieldwork and nationalist publications, this article examines discourse on the Buddha as a nationalist. First, it argues that Burmese Buddhist nationalism, analytically, should be understood as a ressentiment ideological discourse that also informs a Buddhist-nationalist discipline claimed to bring karmic merit. Second, it traces the roots of this ideology to the colonial period. Third, the article outlines and seeks to define how ‘Buddhist nationalism’ should be understood in an emic sense.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1610810,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
60,"Secularity, gender, and emancipation: thinking through feminist activism and feminist approaches to the secular","In this article, I engage with feminist discussions about secularity, gender, and emancipation. The feminist study of the secular was spurred by interventions of Saba Mahmood [2005. The Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and the Feminist Subject. Princeton: Princeton University Press], and can be seen as a critical engagement with at least one basic assumption that underlies much of progressive thinking – that secularism is beneficial for women and LGBTQ subjects. I begin by exploring how the Belgian feminist activist platform Baas Over Eigen Hoofd! (Boss Over One’s Own Head!) builds a locally suited theory and practice of emancipation. I analyse how BOEH! raises questions about gender and secularity. Second, I zoom-out by mapping feminist studies of the secular in Western European contexts, distinguishing various analytical approaches and visions on social-political secular emancipatory alternatives.

61,"Qur’anic terminology, translation, and the Islamic conception of religion","A key question in the field of religious studies is the extent to which ‘religion’ as a concept ‘translates’ in various cultural contexts, with some arguing that it is a purely Western and academic construct. In this article, I argue that the Islamic understanding of religion as a universal category of human experience with various, distinct manifestations is similar to the concept of religion widely operative in the academic discipline of comparative religion; for this reason, Islamic terms related to religion can easily be translated into terminology broadly found in the study of religion, including the term ‘religion’ itself. I argue, however, that the apparent ease with which one can translate Islamic religious terminology may obscure some important nuances in the Islamic conception of religion that make it both distinct and internally coherent with its broader view of human nature and of its own particular religious system relative to others. Attentiveness to the semantic range and usage of some key terms in Qur’anic and Islamic terminology regarding religion yields a distinctly Islamic conception of religion that is independent of Western, academic theories of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1622837,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
62,When Jesus speaks colloquial Egyptian Arabic: an incarnational understanding of translation,"Al-Khabar al-Ṭayyib bitāʿ Yasūʿ al-Masīḥ (the Good News of Jesus Christ, 1927) is one of the earliest, if not the first, translation of the New Testament into colloquial Arabic. Initiated by the British missionary and civil engineer William Willcocks, the translation responds to different linguistic and ideological tensions at a time when Egypt endeavoured to configure its national identity. In using colloquial Egyptian Arabic, the translation was motivated by the then dominant missionary ethos of translating into the vernaculars, which was propagated at the World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh in 1910. This article has two aims: first to understand Willcocks’ translation in light of two competing conceptualisations of ‘sacred language’ among speakers of Arabic in Egypt; second, to explore the synergy between theology and translation studies and test the viability of theological concepts such as that of ‘incarnation’ in explaining translation phenomena in the sacred context.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1622841,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
63,"Translation, conversion and the containment of proliferation","This article examines the role of translation in conversion to Christianity in South Asia to argue that recognizing translation as a culturally constructed and contingent category entails investigating different definitions of translation at work within different religious cultures. This helps challenge the assumption that a focus on translation is primarily a consideration of equivalence. Rather than take equivalence as universal or normative in examining the role of translation in religious conversion, this article draws attention to alternative definitions and metaphors of translation that are not concerned chiefly with equivalence which complicate the construction of categories such as religion and conversion in the South Asian colonial context. If translation serves as a regime of interpretation by which religious converts construe their relationship with past and present religions, this article argues it is important to engage with their diverse characterizations of translation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1627786,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
64,Im/materialities: translation technologies & the (dis)enchantment of diasporic life-worlds,"This article explores the interaction between materiality and ideality through the work of a translation software technology routinely used in Sikh diaspora communities. The software Sikhi-to-the-Max weaves together subjectivity, religion and linguistic formations making it indispensable for mediating a communicational ecosystem of diasporic life-worlds by enabling translation of a premodern scriptural language between different generations of Sikhs. Sikhi-to-the-Max juxtaposes premodern and modern language formations, in addition to mediating between sonic/affective experiences of music, scriptural text and commentary. Following Deleuze I argue for a new ‘image’ of translation pertinent to the ‘religious’ diasporic lifeworld, an ‘image’ inspired partly by the univocal model of language and world-making embedded in the operating logic of Sikh scripture (gurbani). By contextualizing the communicational models of Sikhi-to-the-Max within the cultural history of imperial translation, this new ‘image’ of translation pushes us to think harder about how the material and the conceptual interact.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1635331,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
65,"Popular print, translation and religious identity","This article examines the circulation of popular religious translations in the 19th century, illustrating how the intersection of religion, print and popular culture fostered greater orthodoxy in religious practices and greater devotion in personal piety. Using a case study of the Marian tradition in Ireland in the mid-19th century, the article questions how the wide circulation of translated religious texts could serve to create a sense of national uniqueness, but also to establish links to a global religious community, particularly in the context of the sectarian dispute. Informed by book history, the article considers the diffusion of ideas and practices through textual trails, the mechanisms of this diffusion, and the societal agency involved in the circulation of texts. It argues that the intersection between translation, reading, and religion furthered a sense of identification within a religious community and contributed to understandings of both textual and spiritual faithfulness.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1622839,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
66,"‘Extraordinary translations’ and ‘loathsome commentaries’: Quranic translation and the politics of the Tamil language, c. 1880–1950","The practice of translating the Quran in Muslim societies is often understood by reference to the Reformation and Protestant Bible translations. The non-translatability of the Quran is counterposed to the radical translatability of the Bible. Furthermore, instances of Quranic translation in Muslim societies are often explained with reference to ‘reform movements’. The article’s aim is to demonstrate the problems that arise from abstracting the experience of post-Reformation Europe into a general theory of the impact of scriptural translation. For this purpose, I will interrogate the case of Tamil translations of the Quran, where Quran translations from the 1920s onwards eclipsed an older history of Quranic translation in the language.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1622835,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
67,The incipience of the future: language and the work of humility in 19-century Western India,"The paper attends to three instances in 19-century Marathi history that point to an older experience of otherness or being-prone. The attempt is to initiate a history of the everyday that does not assume the contours of Enlightenment publicity, but that harks back to an older experience of silence, reticence and withdrawal. Rather than see these as marks of an inner life, the paper traces them back to a crisis of values (primitive nihilism in the context of the modern), one wherein being-prone can be understood in the three instances as the internal fold of a future transformed, language as receptivity and a stance of humility.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1622840,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
68,Primary religious socialization agents and young adults’ understanding of religion: connections and disconnections,"A recurrent critique towards socialization theory is its emphasis on stability and disregard for change. Some case studies in the YARG project, particularly that of Ghana, do indeed point to the central role and influence that young adults ascribe to their primary socialization agents. In these contexts, personal religiosity is described as being in accordance with the values of parents and family, making religious transmission from one generation to another appear like a seamless affair. However, data from these contexts also point to how secondary socialization agents, such as peers, media and secular education, play a central role for how young adults maintain their personal religiosity. The aim of this paper is to analyze how young adults in Ghana, India and Poland describe the role of primary socialization agents on their religiosity, but also, to critically discern this influence as against that of secondary socialization agents. This article builds on both survey and interview data.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1584350,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
69,The role of grandmothers in the religious socialization of young adults in post-socialist Russia and Poland,"Building on the findings of the YARG project, this article examines the enduringly central role of (great) grandmothers in the religious lives and religious socialization of young adults in Russia and Poland. The article highlights the complexities involved in studying the transmission of religious beliefs and values from one generation to the next in social and cultural contexts where religious socialization was severely interrupted for entire generations, and where the religious ‘chain of memory’ to varying extents has had to be forged anew. Arguing that current theoretical perspectives on religious socialization in post-socialist contexts need to be more attentive to extended understandings of family and kin, the article focuses on the enduring influence that (great) grandmothers exert in contemporary modes of religious socialization of children and young people in Russia and Poland. In light of survey data and in-depth interviews with young adult university students in Russia and Poland, the influence of (great) grandmothers is explored in relation to three main dimensions: the inspirational, the instructive, and the supportive. The article illustrates how (great) grandmothers continue to represent a religious element in the lives of Russian and Polish young adults regardless of their own religious engagements and degrees of personal religiosity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1584351,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
70,Two cases of religious socialization among minorities,"Research indicates that religion is particularly important among minority groups (e.g., Pargament 2002). The current study focuses on religious socialization among young adults within two specific religious minorities, (1) Muslims in West Bengal, India, and (2) The Druze in Israel. Specifically, we aim at answering two questions: (a) are these religious minorities more successful at socialization than their corresponding majority religious communities, and (b) how do members of these minorities articulate their religion and socialization into it? Based on a mixed-method study, including survey responses and in-depth interviews, our results answer the first research question affirmatively for Muslims in India, and negatively for the Druze in Israel, suggesting the importance of relating to the specific contextual characteristics of each religious minority separately, and avoiding general conclusions. For both groups, family seems to be the major agent of socialization, and the impact of social media needs further exploration.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1584352,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
71,"From socialization to self-socialization? Exploring the role of digital media in the religious lives of young adults in Ghana, Turkey, and Peru","Previous research has pointed to the central role of media for the current young adult generation when it comes to finding information about religion, exploring beliefs, and developing a religious identity. This article explores how young adult university students in three different contexts – Ghana, Turkey, and Peru – report using digital media for religious purposes. The article builds on previous research on the role of media in religious socialization and explores the usefulness of the notion of self-socialization in a transnational study. The studied contexts are all shown to differ when it comes to levels of self-reported religiosity and use of media for religious purposes. The article illustrates the independent use of digital media in all contexts and self-socialization taking place on a general level, but also highlights the continuous importance of traditional socialization agents, thus questioning simplistic understandings of the role of media in religious socialization.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1584353,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
72,Religious socialization of non-religious university students,"Studies of non-religion and youth raise questions regarding the conceptual usefulness of religious socialization. If religious socialization is studied only as the extent to which intergenerational transmission of religiosity occurs, the religious socialization of those who identify as non-religious falls out of the scope of research. This article explores the religious socialization of a group of university students from Sweden, Finland, Poland, and Israel who identify as non-religious. Interviews with these young adults allow us to explore the (religious) socialization of non-religious individuals in different contexts. The findings point to how the influence of socialization agents turned some of the students onto a path towards non-religion. Others, in turn, are characterized by family backgrounds where religion has not played any significant part. Our findings indicate that religious socialization, broadly construed, can be a useful perspective for understanding varying paths towards non-religiosity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2019.1584355,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
73,Textbooks on ‘Hinduism’: defining an ocean described from myriad shores,"Relying on a textbook in a course that introduces a religious tradition is similar to the scholarly use of the term ‘Hinduism’: both are highly contested, not easily avoided, and yet have their advantages. So, textbooks devoted to Hindu traditions prove particularly problematic and thought provoking not only about who, what, where, and when they describe but also about the pedagogies used by college and university faculty to teach about Hindu religious practices, beliefs, and sentiments, as well as about religion more generally. A comparative deliberation on the four textbooks most often chosen for American and Canadian classrooms offers a glimpse into these complicated yet significant debates and issues pertinent to teaching about other religious traditions as well.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1501872,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
74,Textbooks for teaching the sociology of religion,"The sociology of religion, a vibrant sub-discipline of sociology, is popular amongst students taking degrees in Sociology, Theology, and Religious Studies. Teachers are often not sociology specialists and seek a standard text to help with classes. Others, who specialise in sociology, have usually no background in the study of religion. His review surveys the field of books recommended by teachers and students and finds few to wholly recommend.

75,Replication or rivalry? The ‘Becketization’ of pilgrimage in English Cathedrals,"In 1170 the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in his own Cathedral sent shockwaves through Europe, yet few could have foreseen the spectacular expansion of his cult throughout Christendom in the following decade. While many of the individual structural and performative aspects of his hagiolatry were hardly new, the ‘Becket model’ was to shape the nature of cult within and beyond English cathedrals for the remainder of the Middle Ages. Following the initial burst of pilgrim activity, the monks of Canterbury carefully curated the shape of, and access to, the cult within the Cathedral in order to confirm their role as sole custodians and to promote their political influence. This article provides new readings of the use of sacred space in the cathedrals of Canterbury, Durham, and York, and foregrounds the significance of Becket’s cult in understandings of both medieval and modern constructions of the English pilgrimage experience.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1515327,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
76,"More English than the English, more Roman than Rome? Historical signifiers and cultural memory at Westminster Cathedral","Westminster Cathedral, the Metropolitan church of English Roman Catholicism since 1903, occupies an ambivalent space in the heart of the modern metropolis. It was intended as a repository and symbol of a national, very English, Catholic heritage in central London, replicating and re-using medieval signs and rituals to lay claim to a history that stretched back to the original conversion of England in the late 6th century. Drawing on studies of cultural memory, the authors examine how successive Cardinals of Westminster from the late 19th century onwards designed, constructed, and used the Cathedral to define Catholic identity in the first decades of the 20th century. In this they steered a difficult and often contested course between twin loyalties to the nation and to Rome. The limits of institutional power to reshape cultural memory are also explored through a case study of the Cathedral's resident martyr-saint, John Southworth, acquired in 1930 and similarly revealing the uneasiness of English Catholicism regarding its ‘otherness’ within a national culture.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1515328,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
77,"Caminoisation and Cathedrals: replication, the heritagisation of religion, and the spiritualisation of heritage","This article focuses upon a specific aspect of the revival of pilgrimage in Europe, the replication of the Camino de Santiago. The Camino has become regarded increasingly as ‘prototypical’ pilgrimage, particularly by those previously largely unfamiliar with pilgrimage, and copied in contexts far from Spain. This tendency towards the importation, re-conceptualisation and (to varying degrees) replication of the Camino in the pilgrims’ native countries has led to the revival of ancient pilgrimage routes as well as the development of new ones. ‘Caminoisation’ thus refers to the process of introducing aspects of the Camino pilgrimage to other routes and pilgrimage sites. Among the main features of Caminoisation are the ideas that ‘real’ pilgrimage is done on foot and that the journey is more important than the destination. In addition, the material culture of the Camino is spreading, including pilgrim passports and Compostela-like certificates, as are ritual activities such as pilgrim blessings. Based on our AHRC funded project on Pilgrimage and England’s Cathedrals, Past and Present, (PEC) we examine the growth and variety of pilgrimage activities in the post-Reformation, Anglican contexts of Canterbury Cathedral, York Minster and Durham Cathedral. We explore the renegotiation of pilgrimage, the localisation of Camino features in traditionally Protestant contexts and the implications of Caminoisation for the Anglican Cathedrals studied within the broader milieu of the heritagisation of religion and the spiritualisation of heritage in Europe.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1515325,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
78,Nidaros Cathedral: a recreated pilgrim church,"Nidaros Cathedral in the Norwegian city of Trondheim exemplifies the interplay of Caminoisation and heritagization in a Lutheran context. These processes converge in the recent establishment of pilgrimage in Norway which has made the cathedral an international pilgrim destination, thus reflecting its medieval past when pilgrimage to St Olav’s relic in the cathedral was widespread in Northern Europe. After sketching an overview of the cathedral’s history and the establishment of the modern St Olav pilgrimage, analysis of current perceptions and use of the cathedral as a pilgrim church follows. An aim of the article is to elucidate strategic interests in the Church of Norway and touristic interests in the city of Trondheim involved in the pilgrimage development.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1515340,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
79,"On praying in an old country: ritual, replication, heritage, and powers of adjacency in English cathedrals","This article explores the double identities of English Cathedrals as places of religious engagement but also as locations of heritage. Rather than seeing such functions as only or inherently opposed to each other, with liturgy compromised by tourism, or religious seriousness by crass commerciality, it explores the ways in which religious practice, tourism and heritage display exist in adjacent, often mutually productive forms. Such adjacencies may lead to particular contexts and activities of modified mimesis and replication between religious and heritage behaviours, which I label ‘merging,’ ‘modes of address,’ and ‘enactment.’ Overall, my analysis assesses the influence not only of the market, but also of management culture, on cathedral governance in the contemporary era.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1515326,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-49
80,Latin America 1520–1600: a page in the history of the study of religion,"This article examines the texts written by the first generation of missionaries on the beliefs and mores of the indigenous people of what came to be called Mexico and Peru, supplemented by some accounts written by travelers in Brazil. These works claimed to put forward knowledge about ‘the others’. It is argued that they were important precursors for the study of religion and should receive more attention as such. The issue of location is shown to be always present in this early material, along with the biological notion of hybridization. The conclusion asks whether the contemporary pursuit of knowledge can move from the biological unity of the human race to a view of the race as a social whole with common interests.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1500161,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
81,Religion in the making: the Lived Ancient Religion approach,"For the past five years (2012–2017), the Max Weber Center of Erfurt University has hosted a project on ‘Lived Ancient Religion: Questioning “cults” and “polis religion”’, financed by the European Research Council and embedded in the research group on ‘Religious individualisation in historical perspective’ (see Fuchs and Rüpke. [2015. “Religious Individualisation in Historical Perspective.” Religion 45 (3): 323–329. doi:10.1080/0048721X.2015.1041795]). It was designed to supplement existing accounts of the religious history of the Mediterranean area at the time of the long Roman Empire, accounts traditionally centred upon public or civic institutions. The new model focuses on the interaction of individuals with a variety of religious specialists and traditions, taking the form of material culture, spaces and text. It emphasises religious experience, embodiment and ‘culture in interaction’. On the basis of research into the history of religion of the Roman Empire, this co-authored article sets out to offer new tools for research into religion by formulating three major perspectives, namely religious agency, instantiated religion and narrated religion. We have tried to illustrate their potential value by means of 13 short case studies deriving from different geographical areas of the central and eastern Mediterranean area, and almost all relating to the period 150 BCE to 300 CE. These short descriptions are summarising research pursued by the members of the team of authors, published or to be published in extended form elsewhere, as indicated by the references.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1450305,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
82,How does knowledge bring one to the state of immortality in early Upaniṣadic philosophy? A new perspective on the ‘Magical’ way of cognition,"The Upaniṣadic philosophers believed that acquiring certain knowledge would lead them toward a state of immortality. Merely by obtaining that knowledge, they thought people could surmount the various causes of death of the natural body. How and why did they develop and maintain this belief? To understand this, this article analyzes the difference between our views as modern humans and those of early Upaniṣadic philosophers, regarding the concepts of knowledge and death. They seem to have believed that knowing a concept meant actualizing that concept in the real world. Therefore, possessing the concept or knowledge of death guaranteed the actualized occurrence of death. This article argues that early Upaniṣadic philosophers must have thought that replacing the knowledge of death with the true knowledge of immortality would really make people immortal. In other words, to know that one is immortal truly makes one immortal. I also propose a new method of analyzing ancient thoughts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1466002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
83,"Ties that bind: Pentecostal churches, youth gangs, and the management of everyday life in the urban barrio","In this article, I juxtapose Pentecostal churches with youth gangs, two popular barrio institutions that at first glance appear to be irreconcilable but when considered together evince organic parallels that reveal important insights into contemporary life in urban poverty. Reflecting on ethnographic data from the Dominican Republic and elsewhere, I argue that due to an analogous ritualization of everyday life – through rigorous rules and clearly defined consequences for breaking them – both Pentecostal churches and youth gangs, despite their ostensible differences, afford a unique kind of freedom in constraint, and by providing reliable spaces of predictability, control, and mastery, have become popular stages for managing the precariousness of barrio life in late modernity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1466003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
84,Compassion and purity: the ethics and boundary-making of Christian evangelicals,"The paper explores the ethical attitude of Christian evangelicals in a church in Britain and how it affects boundary-making of their community. Evangelicals in the case study seek to be accepting of the person and to refrain from being judgemental. The paper distinguishes between the person-centred ‘ethic of compassion’ and the norm-centred ‘ethic of purity’. The ethic of compassion consists in accepting another and recognising the dignity of another based on shared humanity. It is a frame of mind that combines moral intention with the emotions of empathy and sympathy. In contrast, the ethic of purity privileges adherence to the moral order of the group over considerations for the person. The ‘compassionate’ frame of mind weakens boundaries, while the ‘pure’ frame of mind reinforces them. The boundaries of a community result from the interplay of the two ethics.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1470117,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
85,Judges and Jews: congregational conflict and the Protestant secular in 19th-century America,"This article shows how 19th-century Jews embraced the American legal system. In spite of the rhetoric of ‘religious freedom’ the fact that religious congregations were legal corporations meant that they were never fully ‘free’ from government oversight. In the absence of clear religious authorities, American Jews regularly invited state oversight into their religious affairs, and, seeking legal victory, they worked alongside judges to fit the dictates of Jewish law to the Protestant assumptions of American secularism. Three instances of Jewish congregational strife, dealing with practice, employment, and membership, are closely analyzed to demonstrate how outsider religious communities strategically navigated a legal system that was allegedly neutral but presumptively Protestant.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1520751,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
86,Living on a prayer: neo-monasticism and socio-ecological change,"Neo-monasticism, including the desire to live in Christian intentional community, is increasingly popular in the United States. Communities are structured around a rule or shared covenant that outlines the parameters of living in community. Daily prayer is often a central feature to neo-monastic life as is an emphasis on socio-ecological justice. Drawing on recent Christian theology about gardens, a popular neo-monastic book of common prayer, interviews with practitioners of neo-monasticism, and fieldwork conducted with a nascent neo-monastic community in the southeastern United States, this article argues that prayer acts as a religious technology of the self for socio-ecological change. Through prayer, participants of intentional communities change, and this in turn leads to acts that alter the socio-ecological worlds around them.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1520752,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
87,Christmas fairs in Danish churches abroad: a resource mobilisation perspective,"An important source of income for Danish churches abroad is the profit from the traditional Christmas fairs. Arranging a successful Christmas fair requires that the church engages in a resource mobilisation effort to get donations of goods and free services for the fair and to raise voluntary labour among the local expatriate Danes. This requires a concern for both Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft. Data on economy and number of person-hours spent on Christmas fairs at five Danish churches abroad showed that the profitability of the fairs could be questioned in some cases. During field studies at three of these Christmas fairs, I investigated many volunteers’ motives for spending their time and efforts on the Christmas fair. I also tested their willingness-to-accept (hypothetically) to substitute the Christmas fair with an annual lump sum. The answers showed that the Christmas fairs are highly valued for their strengthening of Gemeinschaft in the expatriate milieu.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1482613,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
88,"From nation-state to market: The transformations of religion in the global era, as illustrated by Islam","This article has three parts. The first analyses how notions of the market and of marketisation have been literally and metaphorically applied to the study of religion. The article argues in favour of thinking consumption as the circulation and exchange of symbols rather than goods, and therefore reintegrates economic phenomena into the fold of history and socio-anthropology. The second part argues that the major transformations of the last half-century are best understood as the shift from a national-statist religious regime to a market regime cast against the backdrop of globalisation. The rise of consumerism as a social and cultural ethos, the spread of neoliberal and managerial ideologies, are the key processes which underlie a major reconfiguration of societies and cultures on a global scale. The third part argues that the important mutations occurring within Islam – as illustrated by Indonesian Islam – demonstrates the heuristic potential of the suggested approach.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1482615,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48

The discussion focuses on the respective virtues and weaknesses of approaches that view ‘religious markets’ in terms of a de facto empirical entity on the one hand, and approaches that instead employ the ‘market’ as a metaphor for how the religious field is structured and organized on the other hand. The article then proceeds to outline and argue for the adoption of a broader marketization-focused perspective that views ongoing changes in the religious field against the backdrop of wider neoliberal socio-economic restructurings of the global political economy and social institutional fields.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1482616,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
90,Governing religious identities: law and legibility in neoliberalism,"This article explores from a Foucauldian perspective how, in the neoliberal age, religious diversity has become a new form of governmentality that is based on practices of classifying and categorizing people according to religious criteria. Contributing to studies on religion and marketization, the article explores how religious diversity is promoted as a category of social order and coexistence and develops two ideas: first, religious diversity is a legal-political form of governmentality geared towards rendering complex populations legible for administrative purposes. Second, religious diversity reflects an economic form of governmentality, in that its legal doctrinal cognates (subjective definitions of religion, sincerity of belief, etc.) call forth liberal notions of consumer choice. While both are premised on the idea that people have identities, there are potential tensions between both forms, as the first tends to favor collectives and the second favors individuals. The article is based on research in Spain and Canada.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1482611,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
91,Religion and the marketplace: constructing the ‘new’ Muslim consumer,"Despite the prediction that modernization would lead to secularization, the past 30 years brought a global resurgence of religion. As many scholars note, religion has gained a new visibility in the contemporary political economy and become firmly embedded within the identity politics. The changing role of religion is linked to the growing influence of neoliberalism and the expansion of the market logic. In this study, I look at the intersections between Islam, consumption, and market and trace the shifts in the conceptualizations of Muslims in relation to the changing market dynamics and the broader socio-political and economic structures. I discuss three phases through which the view of Muslims as modern consumers in search of distinction and propriety comes to dominate the view of Muslims as non- or anti-consumers: exclusion, identification, and stylization. I conclude by discussing the implications of the study for the current understandings of the marketization of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1482612,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
92,The marketization of church closures,"In recent years, the impact of marketization on the religious field has gained increasing attention within sociology of religion. However, one of the recurring issues has been how to define marketization. In this article, I propose a particular theoretical definition focusing on the intertwinement of neoliberalism and New Public Management, and by using Critical Discourse Analysis I find that demands for structural reorganization, i.e., closing churches, in the Diocese of Copenhagen increasingly makes use of the discourse of marketization. I examine the consequences of two municipality reforms from 1970 and 2007 on the Diocese, trying to pinpoint instances of marketization, before analyzing how the issue of church closures becomes the focal point in the structural discussions from 2005 to 2013. By exploring the minutes from the Diocese council, I argue that marketization has become embedded in the institutions within the Church to the point where it has become a cultural dominant.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1482617,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
93,"‘Allah has spoken to us: we must keep silent.’ In the folds of secrecy, the Holy Book of the Druze","This article explores the cultural dynamics of bond and separateness created around the Book of Wisdom (kitâb əl-ḥikma), the Druze Holy Book. The Text, unrevealable to Druze non-believers or foreigners, is shrouded in a collective pact to ‘keep quiet’. I assert that this alliance aims to protect Druze intimacy rather than highlight their separateness from others. It is rooted in the Druze premise that meaning is both corporeal and feminine, that it pertains to an ineffable interiority. I thereby distance myself from anthropological analyses that consider the so-called Druze secret around the Book as static content solely related to language.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1386370,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
94,Charismatic mediumship and traditional priesthood: power relations in a religious field,"In the Indian Himalayas, mediums who operate as channels through which deities can communicate with their devotees, function alongside priests who serve these deities. In this article, we examine the relationship between these two religious roles with regard to the deity Mahāsū. At the individual-personal level we examine how their roles are linked to different sources of authority – whereas the priests’ source of authority is traditional, the mediums rely on charisma. At the societal level, we maintain that their different caste backgrounds are essential for understanding their public role. While the priests are Brahmins, almost all the mediums of Mahāsū are Rajputs. Thus, the medium institution enables the Rajputs, who make up the vast majority of Mahāsū’s devotees, to retain in their hands all decisions pertaining to the public sphere. Hence, they carry more political–social clout than the priests, because they can change the social-religious order or sustain it.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1394397,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
95,"(Re)producing Buddhist hegemony in Sri Lanka: advancing the discursive formations of self-Orientalism, religious (im)mobility and ‘unethical’ conversion","This paper explores how Buddhist groups in Sri Lanka attempt to suppress conversion to Christianity. Conversion to Christianity can dilute the power and legitimacy of Buddhist groups, which has caused them to promote a discourse of ‘unethical’ conversion. My argument is that such a discourse is self-Orientalising in nature, and is designed to enable the (re)production of Buddhist hegemony in Sri Lanka. By constructing Buddhists as vulnerable and in need of protection, the hegemonic actions of Buddhist groups are validated. These constructions serve to restrict the religious (and socio-cultural) mobility of Buddhists, and to legitimise the persecution of Christians through both legislative and violent means. Sensitivity to the effects of self-Orientalism reveals the need for more critical readings of the effects of religious protectionism on both the Christian other, and the national self as well.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1402831,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
96,The not-so-crypto crypto-Jews of New Mexico: update on a decades-old debate,"For over two decades an academic debate has raged over a possible crypto-Jewish presence in New Mexico. On one side are scholars who advance two claims: first, that many of New Mexico’s early colonists were crypto-Jews and second, that practices associated with some Hispano families in modern New Mexico reflect crypto-Jewish traditions originating in the colonial period. On the other side are scholars who question the evidentiary basis of both claims. This article provides an update on this debate by (1) reviewing scholarly reviews of two key monographs published since the debate first erupted in the mid-1990s and (2) by presenting new data relevant to the possibility that modern claims of ‘crypto-Judaism’ derive from Adventist proselytizing. The article concludes with an assessment of the many reasons why the original hypothesis has been, and will likely continue to be, popular despite the doubts that many scholars have raised.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1403397,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
97,Turning students into scholars: using digital methods to teach the critical study of religion,"Incorporating digital tools into Religious Studies courses provides experiences and conditions that transform students into scholars. In this essay we discuss two courses we taught in conjunction with the Religious Soundmap Project of the Global Midwest, a collaborative digital humanities project that we co-directed from 2014 to 2016. Engaging students as contributors to a collaborative digital research project helped them to appreciate some of the key practical, theoretical, and ethical challenges that we face as scholars of religion. In particular, our work together brought to the fore critical questions about definition, classification, and representation. Even more, because they knew their work would be accessible to broader audiences outside the classroom, potentially including the very communities whom they were studying, students were able to perceive the stakes of these questions in ways we had not previously experienced. Incorporating digital tools enabled our students to see themselves as scholars of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1445601,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
98,Collaborative scholarly communities and access in the study of material and visual cultures of religion,"The Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion at Yale University (MAVCOR) does not simply, or even most fundamentally, shape a physical center at Yale University. Although MAVCOR organizes events at Yale and coordinates project cycles involving Yale affiliates as well as scholars from other universities in the United States and around the world, much of MAVCOR’s activity is conducted online. MAVCOR publishes a born-digital, open-access double-blind peer-reviewed journal, MAVCOR Journal. It also features a born-digital exhibition space, the Material Objects Archive. In at least two ways, MAVCOR is deliberately interstitial, invested in the connective spaces between both disciplines and technologies. First, the Center emerged from a desire to promote interdisciplinary conversation among scholars of religion, art history, anthropology, and others engaged with our subjects of inquiry. We have aimed to accomplish this goal by shaping a forum for conversation and an archive for mutual use. Second, MAVCOR engages the need to form a space for peer-reviewed content online in a manner that emphasizes the mutually beneficial relationship of print and digital modes of inquiry. In this work, MAVCOR’s overarching commitment is to promote innovative, substantively researched, thoughtfully constructed scholarship, with robust interdisciplinarity as a fundamental element of form and content.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1445603,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
99,@Preacher_Bot: an experiment in evangelical speech making,"This article is an experiment in digital methodology. It applies tools associated with the digital humanities to the study of Protestant evangelicalism in order to ask what digital research methods can offer the study of religion. Beginning with the development of a social media computer program called a Twitter bot designed to mimic evangelical ministers on twitter, the article considers how digital scholarship allows the work scholars produce to mirror more closely the religious worlds they study. Next, the article analyzes the results of the program using text analysis software. In documenting trends in the bot's output, the article highlights how digital research methods can help answer long-standing questions in the field as well as potentially ask new ones. It concludes, The article, then, is both an exploration of contemporary religious cultures and a consideration of new media methods for analyzing them.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1445073,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
100,Immersion as shared imperative: entertainment of/in digital scholarship,"The modern culture of entertainment is performed across diverse practices and institutions – from Disney to gaming, Hollywood to tourism, museums to commercial consumption – and it prizes being physically and affectively ‘caught up’ in forms of play that transport participants away from everyday reality. Defined in immersive terms, entertainment is pervasive and ideologically compelling. This article explores an analogous relationship between this ubiquitous culture of entertainment and digital scholarship in the critical study of religion. The central case study is an ethnographic and archival project, Materializing the Bible, which examines the social life of scriptures, religious tourism, and processes of material religion. I argue that immersion is a shared imperative between this project of digital scholarship and the empirical phenomenon it seeks to understand. As a contribution to this special issue, the article illustrates how the affordances of working with a digital platform intersect with a theoretical commitment to better understand the relationship between religion and entertainment.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2018.1445074,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
101,Red catechisms: socialist educational literature and the demarcation of religion and politics in the early 19th century,"The catechetical genre not only has a long history in religious but also in political discourse. During the 18th century, catechisms were produced on a vast number of diverse subjects, ranging from secular ethics to sheep breeding. The catechism persisted throughout the 19th century and almost gave shape to the Manifesto of the Communist Party. By this time, however, some socialists were also sceptical of the genre; it was perceived as ambiguous. Catechisms are thus a focal point for changing understandings of politics and religion in 19th-century discourse. This article discusses the production and reception of early 19th-century ‘red’ or socialist catechisms to reveal how the ambiguity of the concept religion was negotiated in the context of the catechetical genre. By locating the debate on catechisms in the discourse on ideology, I show that this genre was a focal point for structural change in the semantic field of religion in modernity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1340357,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
102,Becoming Eastern Orthodox in diaspora: materializing Orthodox Russia and Holy Rus’,"In this article, I draw on interviews and participant observation data from a two-year-long ethnographic study in a Russian Orthodox parish in the United States. I argue that both the Russian Orthodox immigrants and the Protestant converts to Orthodoxy attending this parish may be usefully thought of as diasporic groups. Seeking to construct their particular Orthodox identity, both groups deal with their own physical and symbolic displacements, and attempt to find their place of belonging. I demonstrate how in the process, through reliance on religious narratives, prayer, and Russian Orthodox icons, parishioners construct two overlapping, yet distinctive places of their origin: Holy Rus’ and Orthodox Russia. Finally, attending to how some Orthodox Christians were able to position themselves in two groups simultaneously, I suggest that we think of religious practitioners as able to inhabit two diasporas at once.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1328619,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
103,Exploring identities between the religious and the secular through the attendees of an ostensibly ‘Atheist Church’,"The Sunday Assembly has a complex relationship with atheism and religion. It holds events which look and feel like religious worship, but uses this format to create a ‘godless congregation’. Described as an ‘atheist church’ by the media, members prefer to talk about inclusive communities. If the Sunday Assembly simultaneously embraces and rejects both atheism and religion, then how do attendees identify and describe themselves? We add to the growing literature exploring identities between the religious and the secular, presenting a qualitative study based on interviews with Sunday Assembly attendees. We interrogate three concepts: non-religion, the secular sacred and indifferentism to examine how the identity of Sunday Assembly attendees can be better understood. Our findings show that a significant number of attendees publicly identify as indifferent towards religion, while privately maintaining a more strongly non-religious identity, thus suggesting that for Sunday Assembly attendees, inclusivity is imperative.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1386135,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
104,Collective memory in the making of religious change: the case of ‘emerging Jews’ followers of Jesus,"This study explores a facet of the construction of a new worldwide religious tradition that fuses the beliefs, rituals, and identity claims of both Judaism and Christianity. The Brazilian ‘Messianic Anussim’ comprise former Charismatic Evangelicals that adhere to a variety of Jewish practices. Unlike Messianic Judaism, where Jewish-born people identify themselves as believers in Jesus, or Christian Zionism, where Evangelicals emphasise the eschatological importance of the Jews and Israel this particular community maintains the veneration of Jesus and calls for a purification of Charismatic Evangelicalism while observing Jewish laws. Their calls for a ‘pious restoration’ are guided by a recovered Jewish identity that is inspired by the historical figure of the Bnei Anussim. Based on ethnographic research conducted between 2013 and 2015, this study explores the formation of a new hybrid religious group.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1386136,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
105,Negotiating the spaces: exploring issues of human rights in an Indian text,"This article is an attempt to negotiate the spaces between a number of problematic positions concerning Hinduism and human rights through the close study of one particular text, the Rājadharmaparvan of the Mahābhārata. By examining safeguards and provisions for subjects articulated in the text’s discourse of kingly duty, it engages with some of the arguments forwarded in the theoretical literature on human rights. Here it interrogates, in particular, the idea that Hinduism is distinctively incompatible with these norms in a way other historical or cultural traditions are not. The article concludes by asking whether it is possible to counter Eurocentric tendencies in global debates without furthering illiberal agendas within local ones. Discussing the appropriation of ‘Raj dharma,’ and the texts that deal with it, by the Hindu Right, it briefly outlines some recent moves in human rights theory that help facilitate the reclamation of a rich and plural textual heritage.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1386137,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-48
106,"The sacred, the holy, the numinous – and religion: on the emergence and early history of a terminological constellation","At the turn of the 19th century and in the early 20th century, the sacred (Durkheim, Mauss, Callois), holiness/the holy (Söderblom, Otto) and the numinous (Otto) emerged as key terms in the nascent field of religious studies. These terms set up a discursive space for the study of religion that acknowledged its reality and relevance for modern societies and individuals, but that proceeded independent of confessional theologies and sought to transcend Western-Christian ethnocentrism. By providing a close reading of the works of the above-mentioned scholars, in particular Durkheim, this article revisits the emergence of these terms. In particular, it looks at the different ways in which the sacred, the holy and the numinous were related to religion. The article discusses some differences between the scholars of the sacred and the scholars of the holy in terms of their agendas, aims, and preconditions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1377889,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
107,The reception of Otto and Das Heilige in Japan: in and outside the phenomenology of religion,"In Japan, Rudolf Otto is commonly identified as a precursor of the phenomenology of religion, claiming the sui generis nature of religion. However, the first Japanese translation of Das Heilige was published in 1927, far before the reception of the phenomenology of religion. This article divides the history of the reception of Das Heilige into three periods: before, during and after the heyday of the phenomenology of religion. It also examines both academic and lay receptions of Otto’s work, considering that its paperback version has sold over 53,000 copies. Its major findings are scholars of religion in the pre-war period framed Das Heilige according to a hierarchical dichotomy of the East and the West; post-war, phenomenological scholars empathetically interpreted the work, rejecting this ideological dichotomy; younger scholars have recently attempted more history-conscious, critical analyses; and, largely ‘non-religious’ general readers viewed it as a classic of Western thought, without being disturbed by its claim of Christian superiority.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1357222,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
108,Semantics and the sacred,"This article looks at four different scholarly perspectives on ‘sacred’ – the ineffable sacred, the experienced sacred, the polarized sacred and the contextualized sacred – in order to draw out their implicit presuppositions about meaning. The first two stances presuppose that meaning depends on what bits of language are about (referentialism), and the other two stances presuppose that meaning depends on relations between bits of language (holism). The article concludes three things: these prominent views of ‘sacred’ rest on usually implicit or unrecognized assumptions about the nature of meaning; some of those assumptions explain why certain theories are contentious and problematic and others ground more promising and productive approaches.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1362784,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
109,Defining the sacred in fine art and devotional imagery,"Beginning with a definition of the sacred as a two-fold process of making things special, which consists of accentuation and affiliation, this essay proceeds to argue that things are made sacred in devotional piety and in fine art in parallel ways that configure images within webs of agents. The two kinds of imagery perform in practices of sacralization that move toward different ends. The production of aura is at work in each case, but operates with distinct aims. The essay then presents a historical account of fine art as a modern development tied to the rise of the nation-state, in which secularization extended to making art independent of religious institutions and patrons, allowing it to develop in a way that should be distinguished from devotional imagery. This does not mean that religion withers in the modern era, but that art developed its own mode of sacralization.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1361587,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
110,The sacred and sacrality: from Eliade to evolutionary ethology,"Eliade’s sacred seems to refer to an autonomous entity but close inspection indicates a response to experiences to which we attribute sacrality. This allows the postulation of a natural ‘sacred’ that can be defined, and become the basis for an empirical definition of religion. Such ascriptions are commonly associated with art objects, from narratives and texts to dramas and architecture. Consideration of anthropology and ethology of art reveals a relationship between skill and the sacred, which clarifies the origin and function of 'sacrality' as a cognitive experience characteristic of, but not exclusive to, religious behaviour. The same trait is operative in other behaviours, such as art and sport, but it is less restricted in art and less comprehensive sport. Nonetheless, art and sport (and other secular behaviours) do have an affinity with religious behaviour. They are consanguineous with religion – descendants of a common ancestor.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1362833,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
111,The political sacred and the holiness of life itself,"This article reflects on Agamben’s formulation of the sacred within the political order of the West, contrasting this with the Durkheim/Bellah view of the sacred/profane opposition, and then presenting two arguments that reduction of the sacred to the political is insufficient, one a form of biological reductionism that seeks to locate the sacred within the common, biological nature of human life itself, the other an abductive argument for human transformation in terms of what Sloterdjik has called ‘vertical tension.’ This argument turns out to be one for locating holiness in the very notion of life itself that I wish to ground in the idea of social cognition.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1362727,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
112,Shifting worldviews: modeling sacrality in naturalistic perspective,"In this essay, I offer an exercise in modeling a multifaceted concept of sacrality. I do so within the context of my increasing interest in naturalistic, evolutionary views of human social behavior. I distinguish four genres of behavior and their ethological trajectories where sacrality can thus be re-contextualized, at the same time freeing the term from its essentialized versions in religious studies. The behavioral frames include: making-sacred as dedicating objects for secure respect, defending the subsequent social order from violation, attributing status or prestige to objects, and responding to sacred ‘prompts’ with commensurate actions within niche-specific environments.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1336888,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
113,Some contributions of a psychological approach to the study of the sacred,"This paper examines some of the contributions psychology is making to the study of the sacred and its role in human functioning. The focus here is not on the ontological reality of the sacred, but rather perceptions of the sacred. We suggest that psychological theory and research on this topic offers: a clarification of the meaning of the sacred; new knowledge about sanctification – the process through which people come to perceive the sacred in daily life; a response to criticisms about the scientific study of the sacred; a sharper perspective on the meanings of religion and spirituality; a method for measuring sanctification; knowledge about the ways perceptions of the sacred predict important aspects of human behavior, and; an understanding of the sacred as a product of psychological, social, institutional, cultural, and situational forces. We conclude that the sacred represents a vital phenomenon of interest for religious and spiritual study.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1333205,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
114,Aniconism and the origins of palaeoart,"Contrary to the widely held belief that iconic palaeoart precedes aniconic during the early history of humans, palaeoart commenced as non-iconic forms, and in most parts of the world then settled by hominins continued as such during the Pleistocene. The forms, development and global distribution of such palaeoart are presented within the framework of hominin evolution. Attention is given to the question of the continuation of aniconism after the introduction of iconicity and the apparent connection between the latter and youth. This coincides with the role of aniconism in the world of specific ethnographically studied peoples, such as the Aborigines of Australia and the Jarawas of the Andamans. The neuroscientific explanation of aniconism shows that it is cognitively more complex than iconic depiction. Based on these and other strands of evidence, a general hypothesis of the roles and significance of aniconism in the world’s pre-literate societies, be they extant or extinct, is developed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1288785,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
115,"The real presence of Osiris: iconic, semi-iconic and aniconic ritual representations of an Egyptian god","The ancient Egyptian god Osiris was represented in iconic forms in temple reliefs and statues, in semi-iconic form in the so-called corn-Osiris or Osiris-bed, and in aniconic form as the Djed-pillar. All three variations in iconicity are ritual representations of the god and somehow claim his real presence: the temple reliefs by (textually transmitted) conventions, the corn-Osiris by the real, sprouting corn that fills the Osiris outline or form, and the Djed-pillar by the very universality and immense potential of denoting without (yet) depicting or narrating. The synchronous occurrence of these degrees of iconicity illustrates aniconism as a rhetorical option, a matter of ritual design, not a cognitive or theological stage in the evolution of mankind.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1290717,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
116,The great Iranian divide: between aniconic West and anthropomorphic East,"The Avesta and the Rig Veda, our earliest sources for the Indo-Iranian religious tradition, contain ideas and elements with both aniconic and iconic potential. The cultic iconography in Western and Eastern Iran developed in a remarkably different manner. While the Achaemenian and Sasanian cults were aniconic, Eastern Iranian people, like the Kushans and the Sogdians, not only made use of portrayals of their gods in human form, but also venerated their man-made representations in temples. This article suggests that the reason for this sharp distinction in the nature of the cult between Western and Eastern Iran is the impact of acculturated Greek religious practices, which was much stronger in the East than in the West.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1330989,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
117,"Aniconic propaganda in the Hebrew Bible, or: the possible birth of religious seriousness","The Hebrew Bible promotes aniconistic worship: images of the god Yahweh were prohibited. In the Ten Commandments, aniconism follows immediately after the monolatrous rule not to ‘have’ other gods than Yahweh. The reason for the prohibition against ‘idols’ is Yahweh’s singularity, but not his inherent indescribability; in the Bible, there is no lack of literary images of Yahweh who is described as or compared with humans and animals as well as with meteorological phenomena. Among biblical scholars, aniconism as a religions program has often been regarded as a local, ‘Israelite’, phenomenon. My proposal is to see it in the context of the religious revolutions of the so-called axial age in the middle of the first millennium BCE and regard it as an example of a transformation from a ‘pre-axial’ type of religion, based on cult, ritual and material culture, to an ascetic, and cognitively more sophisticated, form of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1295827,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
118,Aniconism in the first centuries of Christianity,"Scholars generally agree that Christian iconography emerged only in the 3rd century. The absence of earlier, unambiguously Christian artifacts led many scholars to characterize Christians as initially aniconic largely in deference to biblical prohibitions of graven images and to regard the pictorial art’s emergence as a departure from the church’s original disapproval. This essay argues that classical philosophical arguments were even more influential on Christian condemnation of divine images than biblical texts and that when it emerged, Christian art essentially served non-idolatrous didactic rather than devotional purposes. Finally, this essay maintains that the demise of polytheism (and its perceived idolatry) changed both the circumstances and content of the debate over divine images. Whereas earlier censure mainly contended that manufactured objects were incapable of representing an invisible God, later criticism focused more on the problems of representing Christ’s human and divine natures and whether saints’ portraits were proper foci for prayer and veneration.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1316357,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
119,The royal veil: early Islamic figural art and the Bilderverbot reconsidered,"The essay questions the Bilderverbot in early Islam by looking at the contrast established in the scholarship between the strict opposition to iconic theology found either in Muslim religious spaces or in the normative texts (hadith) and the use of figural images in the 8th-century palaces built in the Syrian steppe by the Umayyads. In the first part of this essay, I shall examine how the production of figurative images for the Umayyad palaces was systematically put down to corruption while aniconism was taken as the normative model for Islamic art. Then, I will re-consider a famous painting from Qusayr ‘Amra that provides evidence for a religiously inspired figural art and reflect upon the implications for our understanding of aniconism in early Islam. My main argument is that it was primarily the belief in an invisible God that inhibited the production of images rather than the opposition to images as such.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1319992,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
120,"Stone-agency: sense, sight and magical efficacy in traditions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland","This article examines the materiality and mediality of sacred and ‘magical’ stones in Northern European vernacular belief practices (especially Gaelic traditions). In particular, it considers their attribution to specific deities and metaphysical beings, their role in healing rituals and in enabling humans to perceive metaphysical realms. The paper’s focus – via methodologies and theories recently developed in both religious aesthetics and ‘new materialism’ – is on the materiality and ontology of the objects and the associated visions and the ‘relations’ such stones are understood to have produced. As ‘sites’ of divine agency and efficacy the stones (including orthostats, amulets and prehistoric flints) were imbued not only with spiritual agency, but also placed within an invisible network of relations that linked individuals, non-human animals, the landscape and the metaphysical realms. This panoply of relations is crucial to the aesthetic logic guiding selection and ‘attribution’ to specific deities/spiritual beings. The theoretical framework for this discussion explores the degree to which such material culture can be considered ‘aniconic’ and the attendant conceptualisation of ‘efficacy’ and ‘agency’ as applied to interpreting the religious function of the stones.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1294523,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
121,Śiva’s multiplicity of presence in aniconic and iconic form,"The early medieval Śaiva Siddhānta school, a theistic school of Hinduism, positively embraced material forms as means for worshipers to approach the god Śiva. Theistic schools of thought like the Śaiva Siddhānta and their iconophilic ritual practices are responsible for the profusion of religious images we see in Hinduism. This essay examines how priests and worshipers addressed these issues in early medieval South India. There are two primary themes. One is Śiva’s material polymorphism. According to the Śaivas, Śiva intervenes pervasively throughout the cosmos. Therefore, the material forms that he may inhabit are also many and diverse. The annual temple festival provides a rich illustration of Śiva’s multiple forms. The second theme is the translucency of the material object of worship. Since a consecrated icon is considered replete with Śiva’s presence, a viewer can learn to see with a devotional eye through the materiality of the object to other dimensions of Śiva’s being. The songs of the Tamil poet-saints provide a program for this devotional gaze into the divine fullness contained in a material form.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1329188,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
122,Drawing out the iconic in the aniconic: worship of neem trees and Govardhan stones in Northern India,"Natural entities such as rivers, trees, and mountains have long been worshiped in Hindu India as embodied forms of divinity. This essay examines the devotional tendency to anthropomorphize such aniconic objects as a way of bringing out their personality – in other words, to draw the iconic out of the aniconic. Primary attention is given to neem trees in Banaras – considered to be embodied forms of the goddess Śītalā – and stones from the celebrated Mount Govardhan of Braj – regarded as embodied forms of Kṛṣṇa. Descriptions of the anthropomorphic techniques employed in the worship of these trees and stones are provided along with explanations to demonstrate that they are performed by devotees for the expressed purpose of achieving and nurturing intimate relationships with these natural forms of divinity. Brief consideration is given to contemporary reevaluations of anthropomorphism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1290663,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
123,The Hindu pañcāyatanapūjā in the aniconism spectrum,"The Hindu pañcāyatanapūjā is the worship of five deities that can be in the form of five stones collected from various locations in South Asia. Each of these stones has visual properties which form points of reference to the iconography of the same gods’ anthropomorphic forms. And although the ritual use of these five stones is a clear example of an aniconic cult, their worship evokes anthropopathic properties and, depending on the specific context, anthropomorphic visual characteristics. These visual links and ritual movements between the aniconic, the anthropopathic, and the anthropomorphic are examples of a general fluidity that is characteristic of much of the material that has been described as ‘aniconic.’ Different categories of aniconic religious objects are therefore best understood within a spectrum that encompasses aniconic and figural, as well as theriomorphic and anthropomorphic, properties. The article attempts to situate aniconism within such a wider spectrum of representational options.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2017.1312740,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
124,"Belief, trust, and relationality: a Simmelian approach for the study of faith","Religion has been conceptualised as personal belief in the transcendent. Anthropologists of religion have critiqued such a construct for decades for being based on a Christian Protestant model and one that reflected subsequently modern rationalist Western culture. This construct has increasingly been shown to fail to account for the religiosity of contemporary Christians. Drawing on the sociology of Georg Simmel and based on ethnographic research in a Christian evangelical church, the article proposes a reconceptualisation of religious belief that is experiential and relational. Evangelicals in this case study show that propositional belief plays increasingly a secondary role to belief intended as trust in God and forming a relationship with God and others. Relationships mediate personal religious experience and are shown to be essential to the conversion process, the life of faith, and Christian identity. The study thus bridges the separation between theoretical and empirical works by operationalising Simmel’s sociology.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1266289,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
125,A realist social ontology of religion,"Jonathan Z. Smith famously pointed out that the concept of ‘religion’ is not universal but emerged only in the modern West. Several scholars have drawn from Smith the non-realist implication that the existence of religion apart from that concept is an illusion. The word ‘religion,’ they say, does not refer to something out there in the world. In this article, the author argues that Smith’s point is open to a realist interpretation according to which religion exists in the world, as a transhistorical and transcultural reality, even apart from the concept. To make this case, the author outlines and responds to non-realist positions that draw on genealogical, deconstructive, and linguistic arguments, as well as to the alternative proposal that ‘religion’ is simply a heuristic device. In short, the goal of this article is to argue that a realist social ontology provides the better understanding of the central theoretical term in our field.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1203834,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
126,"Possession consciousness, religious individualism, and subjectivity in Brazilian Umbanda","This article explores perceived changes in patterns of consciousness in relation to possession phenomena among a sector of urban practitioners of the Brazilian religion of Umbanda, and argues that these perceptions have been accompanied by the emergence of a more individualist approach to religious selfhood which aims to lay claim to a particular vision of Umbanda. These Umbandists understand their spirit universe in ontologically plastic terms, relativizing spirit identities much like Umbanda’s founders. The increasing emphasis given to conscious forms of possession tallies with a relatively new attention to the self and its awareness of tradition, thought to be lacking in previous generations. This article also defends that we can produce an anthropological understanding of possession as having cosmogonic rather than just expressive effects.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1198839,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
127,"The power of persuasion: Hindutva, Christianity, and the discourse of religion and culture in Northeast India","The paper will examine the intersection between Sangh Parivar activities, Christianity, and indigenous religions in relation to the state of Nagaland. I will argue that the discourse of ‘religion and culture’ is used strategically by Sangh Parivar activists to assimilate disparate tribal groups and to envision a Hindu nation. In particular, I will show how Sangh activists attempt to encapsulate Christianity within the larger territorial and civilisational space of Hindutva (Hinduness). In this process, the idea of Hindutva is visualised as a nationalist concept, not a theocratic or religious one [Cohen 2002 “Why Study Indian Buddhism?” In The Invention of Religion, edited by Derek Peterson and Darren Walholf. Rutgers: Rutgers University Press, 26]. I will argue that the boundaries between Hindutva as cultural nationalism and its religious underpinnings are usefully maintained in the context of Nagaland because they allow Sangh activists to reconstitute the limits of Christianity and incorporate it into Hindu civilisation on their own terms.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1256845,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
128,Between individualisation and tradition: transforming religious authority on German and Polish Christian online discussion forums,"The aim of this paper is to connect the debates on individualisation and mediatisation of religion and transformations of religious authority online on theoretical and empirical basis. The classical and contemporary concepts of individualisation of religion, rooted in the secularisation debate, will be connected with Campbell’s [2007. “Who’s Got the Power? Religious Authority and the Internet.” Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 12 (3): 1043–1062] concept of four layers of religious authority online. The empirical material consists of a joint analysis of German Christian and Polish Catholic Internet forums. In a transnational comparison, the findings show similar tendencies of individualisation and emerging communities of choice, as well as a lasting significance of textual religious authorities, although different levels of authority are negotiated and emphasised to a varying extent. However, in both cases critique of the Church and religion usually emerges offline, and is then expressed online. While the forums do not have a subversive potential, they facilitate adopting a more independent, informed, and reflexive approach to religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1219882,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
129,The protestant secular in the study of American religion: reappraisal and suggestions,"This article provides a theoretical and historiographical overview of secularism in the study of American religion. It focuses on how scholars have used the concept of the ‘Protestant secular’ in works on law, politics, and culture. Although it has been useful, we argue that this concept has lost some of its analytical utility in the effort to explain secularism predominantly in terms of its Protestant nature. In turn, this article looks to literature on secularism globally in order to suggest ways forward. Refocusing on secularism as a strategy of state governance ought to bring precision to both ‘Protestantism’ and ‘the secular,’ as well as shift attention toward state power and the high stakes of classification. An analysis of this strategy requires investigation into how states produce and police the category ‘religion’ and its neighboring concepts – for example, the ‘secular’ and the ‘superstitious’ – in order to render, manage, and colonize various populations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1244124,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
130,Religious studies as a modern academic discipline in Korea,This article offers a historical and institutional overview of the discipline of religious studies in Korea. It first reviews four early sources of comparative studies: work by Christian missionaries; by Japanese scholars during the period of colonization by that nation; by nationalist Korean scholars who reacted against colonization; and by Korean Christian theologians. The founding of the Korean Association for the History of Religions (KAHR) in 1969 was a key point in the professionalization of the discipline. The field became more firmly established in the late 1980s and early 1990s and has diversified in recent years with a new generation of often foreign-trained scholars. The article ends with a brief discussion of potential contributions that the discipline could make to current debates of national significance.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210400,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
131,Praying for salvation: a map of relatedness,"This article attempts to push Mauss’ work on the sociality of prayer (1909) to its fullest conclusion by arguing that prayer can be viewed anthropologically as providing a map for social and emotional relatedness. Based on fieldwork among deep-sea fisher families living in Gamrie, North-East Scotland (home to 700 people and six Protestant churches), the author takes as his primary ethnographic departure the ritual of the ‘mid-week prayer meeting’. Among the self-proclaimed ‘fundamentalists’ of Gamrie’s Brethren and Presbyterian churches, attending the prayer meeting means praying for salvation. Yet, contrary to the stereotype of Protestant soteriology as highly individualist, in the context of Gamrie, salvation is not principally focused upon the self, but is instead sought on behalf of the ‘unconverted’ other. Locally, this ‘other’ is made sense of with reference to three different categories of relatedness: the family, the village and the nation. The author’s argument is that each category of relatedness carries with it a different affective quality: anguish for one’s family, resentment toward one’s village, and resignation towards one’s nation. As such, prayers for salvation establish and maintain not only vertical – human-divine – relatedness, but also horizontal relatedness between persons, while also giving them their emotional tenor. In ‘fundamentalist’ Gamrie, these human relationships, and crucially their affective asymmetries, may be mapped, therefore, by treating prayers as social phenomena that seek to engage with a world dichotomised into vice and virtue, rebellion and submission, and, ultimately, damnation and salvation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1225905,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
132,Learning to pray the Pentecostal way: language and personhood on the Zambian Copperbelt,"This article examines the role of prayer in the production of the Pentecostal person on the Zambian Copperbelt. While Pentecostal prayer is partly focused on private concerns, and therefore reinforces a classic Protestant notion of bounded, individualised personhood, success in this practice depends on a believer’s ability to incorporate the language of the Pentecostal community. Prayer is also therefore dependent on a model of personhood in which permeability has an important part to play. One of the implications of this latter element of Pentecostal prayer is that it turns individual believers into iconic representations of their communities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1225906,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
133,Praying until Jesus returns: commitment and prayerfulness among charismatic Christians in Ghana,"Charismatic Christians in Ghana display heterogeneous intensities of personal piety, often mapped out by believers to levels of ‘spiritual maturation’. In this article, I examine the devotional routines of ‘committed’ Christians, individuals recognized as ‘prayerful’ subjects. Through Marcel Mauss’ incidental definition of prayer as an ‘expenditure of physical and moral energy’, I investigate ethnographically the methods whereby prayerfulness comes about. I argue that charismatic prayer is not a discernible object of inquiry, but an ongoing field of ethical problematization driven forward by two modes of physical and moral expenditure: habit and anticipation. From this angle, spiritual maturity indicates not a durable ethical asset, but a continuous effort to produce homeostatic balance between these embodied temporal forces. I conclude by stressing how attention to the internal goods of prayer allow us to integrate vulnerability within religious projects, instead of reducing it to an external causal force, as in most deprivation theories of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1225907,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
134,"‘I’ve tempted the saint with my prayer!’ Prayer, charisma and ethics in Romanian eastern orthodox Christianity","Marcel Mauss’ perspective on prayer has the merit of revealing the complex relations between individual experience, sociality and efficacy of prayer. In this article I propose a particular ethical perspective on prayer and these complex relations and also a new ethnographic territory for studying situational, relational and personal practices of prayer. Considering the ethical orientation towards contemporary saints within the Romanian Eastern Orthodox revival milieu I introduce the notion of charismatic exemplar in order to open up the analytical space for studying prayer as ethical practice. I argue that relational ethics reveals that prayer practices work efficaciously within the everyday web of constitutive ethical relationships and are replete with ethical insights into these relationships’ concrete social and historical constitution. Within the Orthodox revival milieu the ethical capacities of engaging in social relationships are prayerfully shaped at the intersection of self-cultivation in terms of an authoritative tradition, charismatic authority/exemplarity and social-historical conditions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1225908,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
135,Repeated prayers: saying the rosary in contemporary Syria,"Mauss' seminal doctoral thesis, On Prayer [1909], captured the social character of prayer, but he sidelined the rosary as a merely mechanical prayer of repetition. This article also finds repetition at play in the rosary, as it is performed in the shrine of Our Lady of Soufanieh, Damascus, in pre-2011 Syria. However, it argues that repetition need not be conceptualised as dulling and inhibiting for the devotee. Rather, repetition can be seen like a heartbeat: something alive and pulsating. The repetition of the prayers among the followers is seen as unforced, a voluntary response to a grace already bestowed upon them by the Virgin Mary and Christ. Prayers are a response to this grace and, in this sense, repetition is to be understood as re-petition. This re-petition is seen as modelling the individual in the image of the Virgin Mary and, by this, exemplifying the saintly character of the devout.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1237158,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-47
136,Fiction and religion: how narratives about the supernatural inspire religious belief – introducing the thematic issue,"This article introduces a thematic issue of Religion that interrogates the religious use of fantasy and science fiction in the contemporary religious field. The overall aim of the thematic issue is to identify those textual features that make it possible for a given fictional story to be used as a religious narrative, that is, to inspire belief in the supernatural beings of the story-world, and to facilitate ritual interaction with said beings. The contributions analyse the religious affordance and actual use of a wide range of texts, spanning from Harry Potter and Star Wars, over The Lord of the Rings and late 19th-century Scandinavian fantasy, to the Christian Gospels. Over the course of the thematic issue, the conclusion emerges that there exists a hierarchy of three levels of religious affordance that fictional narratives can possess: to afford belief in the supernatural beings of the story, a text must present those supernatural beings as real within the story-world; to afford ritual interaction with said beings, a text must include model rituals and inscribe the reader into the narrative; to afford belief in the historicity of the narrated events, a text must anchor the story-world in the actual world. Although we focus on the religious affordance of fictional texts, we also spell out implications for the study of religious narratives in general, and for the narrativist study of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1226756,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
137,The difference between religious narratives and fictional literature: a matter of degree only,"The existence of fiction-based religion makes it obvious to examine the relationship between fictional literature and religious narratives. Although the fiction-religion distinction is tangentially related to the faction-fabrication divide, the author argues that they do not amount to the same. Rather than pursuing the question of what differentiates fictional from religious narratives, the author focuses on those elements in fictional literature that enable interpretative communities to attribute them a religious character. Three assertions come to the fore of the discussion. He considers them crucial for how narratives may be attributed a religious nature: (1) narratives may be assigned religious status in so far as they include a repertoire of p-s-t-coordinates (person, space, and time) that allows elements of the story-world to be projected onto an actual landscape; (2) narratives may be ascribed religious status in so far as they include agents with counter-intuitive abilities who are capable of intervening in the world of the ordinary recounted figures. By virtue of this contrast, distinguishing the characters in the story-world, the relationship between counter-intuitive agents and ordinary persons may be transposed onto a comparable distinction between different worlds in the world of the interpretative community; and (3) narratives may be assigned religious status in so far as they by virtue of embedded discourses and openness or indeterminacy with respect to p-s-t-coordinates, invite readers to view their own lives in continuity with the recounted world.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1221670,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
138,The religious affordance of fiction: a semiotic approach,"A curious aspect of late modern religion is the emergence of fiction-based religions, such as Jediism, based on George Lucas’ Star Wars saga, and Tolkien spirituality, based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s literary mythology about Middle-earth. This article draws on narrative semiotics to explain why some fictional narratives (and not others) afford religious use and have hence given rise to fiction-based religions. I show that to afford religious use it is not enough that supernatural fiction tells about supernatural agents; it must also, to some extent, construct an aura of factuality around these supernatural agents. The main aim of this article is to identify and discuss those textual ‘veracity mechanisms’ that in various ways can help achieve such a sense of factuality. Each veracity mechanism is discussed and illustrated with examples from supernatural fiction, especially from Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. I furthermore show how conceptual blending theory can be used to analyse the cognitive processes involved in the religious interpretation of supernatural fiction. While the empirical focus is on supernatural fiction and fiction-based religion, the wider implications for the study of religious narratives are discussed throughout.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210392,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
139,"Contemporary fantasy fiction and representations of religion: playing with reality, myth and magic in His Dark Materials and Harry Potter","Often fiction and religion have been seen as separate moments or genres, but recent encounters between the two fields – such as fiction-based religions or religious controversies with regard to works of fiction – show that a thorough discussion of the religious in the fictional and the fictional in the religious is important. It may be consequential for what we understand religion to be in the study of religions today. The fantasy genre, with its other worlds, magic and superhuman characters, is extremely successful in contemporary Western popular culture. This article discusses the genre of fantasy fiction and analyses how selected examples of contemporary fantasy fiction represent and mediate religion. It argues that fantasy fiction both reflects and forms religious interests and religious fascination in contemporary society, and, in combination with the related new virtual worlds of the supernatural, fantasy fiction, that it provides sites for exploration of religion. This article is not a study of new religious movements, or of locating and analysing classically religious practitioners who use fantasy fiction in religions. Rather, the author seeks to understand the current pervasive presence of religion in fantasy fiction, and to discuss its significance in contemporary Western societies, as well as its implications for the understanding of religion. The author suggests that we should acknowledge, to a greater degree, the extent to which religion can be mixed with commerce, titillating entertainment, shared emotions, and everyday concerns. In addition, the author suggests that we should make more room for partial and shifting religious engagements in religion, and acknowledge a place, in the category of religion, for supernatural popular culture. The current fantasy popularity surge indicates not only a weakening of institutionalised religions, but also of the importance of belief and absolute truth claims in religion, and instead we see an increased visibility of ‘the religious’ and shifting and partial forms of religion in the West.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1212526,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
140,"Fiction into religion: imagination, other worlds, and play in the formation of community","Research into religions founded upon explicitly fictional sources is a recent development in the study of religion. Such research is social scientific in orientation and emphasises: the persuasive power of shared narratives among subcultural groups; the ‘cognitive’ methodological turn that has gained ground since the 1980s regarding the origin and function of religion; and the individualistic and affective ways that elements from traditional religion, popular culture, and a wide range of social artefacts and phenomena are used to create new religions and personal spiritualities. In certain cases, exposure to, prolonged immersion in, and social vindication of highly affective narratives (science-fiction novels and films that are sensuous and have tangible impact in experiential terms) may trigger the formation of a religion. This article examines the Church of All Worlds, which is a fiction-inspired religion founded by Tim Zell (b. 1942) and Lance Christie (1944–2010), two students at Westminster College, Fulton, Missouri, in April 1962. Zell and Christie read Robert A. Heinlein’s science-fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land (London: New English Library, 1961 [1987]), and initiated a ‘real world’ version of the fictional Church, founded by Martian-raised Valentine Michael Smith in the novel. Identification with Stranger’s characters, and lifestyle choices designed to recreate the social milieu of the novel, reinforced and made ‘real’ this initially fiction-based religion, which is now over 50 years old, has a vibrant print and online presence, and braches (called Nests) in countries including the United States, Britain, Germany, and Australia.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210390,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
141,On elves and freethinkers: criticism of religion and the emergence of the literary fantastic in Nordic literature,"In the late 19th century, the relationship between fictional literature and religion was up for debate. On the Nordic literary scene, this debate was triggered by Danish literary critic Georg Brandes in 1871, when he famously announced a turn towards critical realism. Fiction was identified as a possible link between secular and religious representations of reality, and modern literature was supposed to act as a catalyst for the criticism of religion. In the following years, literature became the medium to explore the ‘problem of religion’, the utopia of an atheist society and the mysteries of the human mind. This article traces major theoretical impulses and their literary substantiations from 1870s literary realism to the emergence of the literary fantastic in the 1890s. In the literary fantastic, the criticism of religion became religiously productive. Anticipating the cognitive study of religion, folkloristics explained supernatural concepts as the natural result of ordinary mental mechanisms. This radical naturalism allowed for an inclusion of the supernatural in literary realism. The case study of Haugtussa (1895), a work by the Norwegian author Arne Garborg, shows the lasting re-configuration of the understanding of religion that gave way to a ‘modern religiosity’ based on fiction.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210394,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46

It also offers a critique of the book’s relative inattention to the sound effects of these popular video films, suggesting that there are resonant affinities between aural media, regimes of audibility, and the affective presence of the spiritual ‘beyond.’",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210391,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
144,Sensational Movies and the anthropology of religion: towards a comparative moral imaginary,"This article examines the significance of Birgit Meyer’s work on the ‘moral imaginary.’ The first part of the article argues that Meyer has more in common with phenomenological anthropologists than she admits and endorses her approach to the current debate between ‘ontological’ and ‘cultural constructivist’ approaches. The second section invokes the moral psychology of Maimonides along with contemporary debates in the anthropology of Islam to argue that Meyer’s work should stimulate a broadly comparative approach to the whole topic of moral imagination. Do filmic media, for example, inevitably favor a dualistic conflict between personifications of good and evil over other, more monistic, religious positions? And how might the study of medieval moral psychologies enrich the contemporary ethnography of religion?",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210393,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
145,Materializing the study of religion,This response to Meyer’s work focuses attention on the materiality of studying religion and how the sociality of religious practice may be studied in material terms. The value of this approach and the manner in which it is conducted vary from more traditional approaches to religion by offering a different conception of what religion is and does.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210395,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
146,Comments on Sensational Movies,"This response to Birgit Meyer’s Sensational Movies engages the book as a study of how Pentecostal ideas are transferred into popular entertainment and back into the church. It explores the close connection between the video films and interventionist theology, in which the power of God may be invoked to deal with supernatural evil in the lives of people. In closing, a number of virulent issues for Christian life and theology in Ghana are identified. Among these are: the omnipresent and hyperactive nature of supernatural evil in the African religious imagination; the demonization of traditional religion as a ‘demonic doorway;’ the creation of Christian ritual contexts for dealing with the effect of demons; the idea that money, power, and wealth are impossible to obtain merely through hard work; and the close relationship between prosperity and evil.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210396,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
147,Imagination and the crossing of boundaries: some theological reflections,"In this response to Birgit Meyer’s book Sensational Movies, the author will focus on the theological possibilities of her study, in particular with regard to two aspects: the role of the imagination and the imaginary; and the ways in which the boundaries that separate the visible and invisible, the spiritual, and everyday life are blurred in the video films so that the two spheres can touch each other. In addition, for both of these aspects, the author sees a strong potential to further elaborate their embodied dimension in a fruitful contribution to media studies, anthropology, religious studies, and theology.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210397,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
148,"Imagining tradition: heritage, culture and religion in contemporary Ghanaian cinema culture","This article is a response to Birgit Meyer’s chapter ‘Mediating Traditional Culture’ from her book Sensational Movies: Video, Vision, and Christianity in Ghana. It reflects on her argument about heritage as a dominant discourse in debates about religion and culture in the Ghanaian video film industry, raises questions about the dynamics of this politics of representation, and outlines the significance of her approach for theorising heritage. It draws on a series of observations about sites of culture and heritage in contemporary Ghana to frame a discussion about dominant themes that emerge in Meyer’s chapter, namely, chiefs and chiefly authority, the genre of the 'epic,' and audience perceptions of mediations of tradition and culture. It concludes by pointing out the usefulness and value that a focus on imaginaries, media, and mediation brings to the study of heritage.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1210398,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46

150,Taking liberties and making liberty: religious bounding and political violence in Sri Lanka,"This paper argues that the relationship between religion and violent politics is best understood through a focus on religious practice. The case study of the Tamil Catholic Church within Sri Lanka's civil war is presented against a backdrop of Buddhist monk participation in violent insurgency decades earlier. The discrete cases evidence a common preoccupation with management of physical borders and discursive boundaries as actors seek to reproduce themselves and their work as legitimately ‘religious’. Despite relying on remaining ‘pure’ from the dirty political realm, in practice religion is bound to social action and reproduced through the violent circumstances it engages.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1139012,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
151,"Christianity, place/space, and anthropology: thinking across recent research on evangelical place-making","Place-making is a central activity for Christian groups. Yet the scholarly literature contains little comparative conversation on local Christian theories of place. This article ‘thinks across’ ten ethnographic descriptions of evangelical communities in order to pay attention to what these Christians pay attention to in their everyday place-making. It discusses seven problematics that commonly recur in evangelical place-work (namely linguistic, material, temporal, personhood, translocal, transcendent, and worldly concerns). This analysis nuances current anthropological debates on Protestant materiality, temporality, and personhood. The article argues that a central tenet of evangelicals’ place-making is a simultaneous taking apart and bringing together of faith and place. This results in a simultaneous fusing and ‘unfusing’ of situation and setting, which cannot be labeled either dis-placement or thorough emplacement. More broadly, evangelical place-making provides a modern example of deterritorialization that is different from placeless-ness. It also speaks to the complex interplay between ideals, intentionality, and agency.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1143054,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
152,Socialist religion and the emergence of occultism: a genealogical approach to socialism and secularization in 19th-century France,"It is often assumed that the history of 19th-century France was determined by a struggle between anti-religious progressive reformers and Catholic reactionaries, culminating in laïcité. In this process, the role of socialism as a secular force is usually taken for granted. This article will argue that a more complex approach to socialism can contribute to a better understanding of secularization and the emergence of “modern” forms of religion. Firstly, it will be discussed that pre-1848 social reformers were highly religious, despite their depiction in historical narratives influenced by Marxism. Secondly, it will be shown that socialist ideas continued, after 1848, in new religious movements. This will be demonstrated on the basis of the intellectual development of the socialist Alphonse-Louis Constant who, under his pen-name Eliphas Lévi, is regarded as the founder of occultism. An analysis of his writings will help to illuminate the ambiguous relationship between socialism and secularization.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
153,"‘A man after god’s own heart’: charisma, masculinity and leadership at a charismatic Church in Brighton and Hove, UK","This article suggests that the gendered aspects of charisma have so far been overlooked in recent scholarship and seeks to align studies of charismatic religious leaders more fully with studies of masculinity and the ‘masculinisation’ of Charismatic churches. Based on research conducted at the Church of Christ the King (CCK) in Brighton and Hove, UK, I analyses how leadership operates as a key language for mediating masculinity, giving young men ways of being manly within both Christian and church parameters as well as forming links between experienced leaders and their young apprentices. Focusing on a dramatic visit by a notorious international preacher as an instance of charismatic masculinity in action, the author shows how an understanding of a corporate culture of masculinity can lend new insight into our understanding of charisma as both a relational construct and a system of individual authority which is tested at times of crisis and succession.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1169452,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
154,Lifelong minority religion: routines and reflexivity: A Bourdieuan perspective on the habitus of elderly Finnish Orthodox Christian women,"Applications of the concept of habitus to research on religion have increased in recent decades. At present, Pierre Bourdieu's interpretation of the concept is perhaps the most well known. Nevertheless, it has also met with criticism. This article utilizes Bourdieuan theorizations to discuss the habitus of elderly Finnish Orthodox Christian women. The author examines the women's dispositions in relation to their changing minority position within Finnish society, and identifies the dynamic between reflexivity and routine practice as being central to their religion. The analysis demonstrates the value of Bourdieu's understanding of habitus when studying the long-term effects of social power on subjectivity – as reflected, for instance, in lifelong minority religion. The author argues, moreover, that contrary to the claims of many critics, Bourdieu's approach is suitable for inquiries into the conscious dimensions of practicing, in so far as these are conceived of as grounded in individuals’ past and present conditions of religious practice.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1104397,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
155,Reverse-engineering ‘esotericism': how to prepare a complex cultural concept for the cognitive science of religion,"The article introduces a framework for preparing complex cultural concepts for the cognitive science of religion (CSR) and applies it to the field of Western esotericism. The research process (‘reverse engineering') rests on a building block approach that, after problematic categories have been deconstructed, seeks to reconstruct new scholarly objects in generic terms that can be operationalized in interdisciplinary contexts like CSR. A four-step research process is delineated, illustrated by a short discussion of previous work on ‘Gnosticism,' ‘magic,' and ‘religion,' before applying it to ‘esotericism.' It is suggested that the implicit scholarly objects of esotericism scholarship can be reconstituted in generic terms as concerned with processes of creating and disseminating ‘special knowledge.' Five definitional clusters are identified in the literature; these provide a basis for formulating research programs on the psychological and cognitive level, drawing on metarepresentational processes, event cognition, and psychological dispositions for altering experience.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1072589,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
156,The “Jewish Knight” of Slobodka honor culture and the image of the body in an Ultra-Orthodox Jewish context,"Scholarship on Ultra-Orthodox Jewish thought has traditionally assumed that the views of these communities derive from a struggle against the Jewish Enlightenment and Zionism, as well as against any values they identify as “modern.” This article challenges that assumption. Beginning with an examination of Ultra-Orthodox sources that present an image of the religious leader as the “ideal Jew,” the author then focuses on sources concerning the founder of the Slobodka Yeshiva in Lithuania. This rabbi intended his students to internalize “modern” norms found in the European honor culture of his time, while translating them into the language of Jewish Ultra-Orthodoxy. The author chooses to present his argument by tracing the image of the body in the Slobodka method, since it is precisely through the nexus of the body that Ultra-Orthodox Judaism was segregated from general European society and culture.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1061064,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
157,Textbooks for teaching the anthropology of religion: a review,"Written from the perspective of those who teach the anthropology of religion, the paper reviews a selection of texts commonly used in teaching. The authors find the texts are generally useful, although those written clearly and with good cross-referencing detail (index, bibliography, overviews) are the most helpful. One major finding is the range of views over what might constitute 'textbook’ - itself a fairly contested term more widely.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1074406,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
158,Textbook Buddhism: introductory books on the Buddhist religion,"Textbooks on Buddhism comprise a large, varied genre and have long been used to introduce the religion to students in academic settings. This review essay examines ten textbooks on the subject, noting their distinctive features, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as the types of courses that are well suited to each work. Additional information from a survey on Buddhism textbooks conducted by the author is used to supplement our understanding of which sources are regularly used in Buddhism courses and why. Unresolved tensions over whether to stress the coherence or diversity of Buddhism, and how comprehensive a textbook should be, are noted. Arguing that ‘Textbook Buddhism,' as a product of scholarly imagination, is a distinctive form of the tradition, it behooves specialists to be more reflective about their use of textbooks and to be more intentional in helping students to read them critically.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1091217,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
159,Between critics and caretakers: current introductions to Islam,"Among a general abundance of literature on Islam, a number of books by scholars of religion and Islamicists have now found regular use in religious-studies programs. This article examines recent introductions to Islam, written by academics, and distinguishes between introductory books in general and textbooks that share more specific features. All books undergo assessment with respect to such qualities as accessibility, structure, and content. Moreover, two broader approaches come into view: some books seek to counter “misrepresentations” of Islam by extremists and the media and try to present a more sympathetic picture of “true” Islam, while others place a stronger focus on the constructed nature of Islam and follow a more critical approach. The books reviewed thus reflect reactions to current developments and discourses as well as the plurality of academic approaches to the field. Aside from more critical assessments, this article contends that some excellent and useful works introduce newcomers not only to Islam itself, but also to the academic study of Islam and religion more generally.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1138630,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
160,Rewriting German and Japanese primeval history: a comparative historical analysis of the Takeuchi monjo and ‘Himmler's Bible',"This study is concerned with two examples of religious re-interpretation of the origins of a ‘nation' legitimated by a text, respectively a ‘corpus' of material of allegedly ancient origin. The first examples are the Japanese Takeuchi monjo (‘Takeuchi texts'), which propose an extended and amended variant of the official ‘State Shintō' and its version of history and became the centre of a small ultra-nationalistic religious movement at the beginning of the 20th century. The second example is a text which was once labelled ‘Himmler's bible', the so-called Oera Linda Boek or Ura Linda Chronik, as it was introduced by its main German interpreter and exegete Herman Wirth in the 1930s. In both cases the texts overturn the view of history and mankind through insights into a so-far undetected prehistory.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1030796,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
161,Quiet beauty: problems of agency and appearance in evangelical Christianity,"How does the cultivation of beauty interact with agency? In this article the author discusses the religious value of beauty for conservative evangelical Christians in the English town of Brighton. Building on the anthropological approach to art and agency developed by Alfred Gell, the author considers the manner in which the everyday of bodies, relationships and personal testimonies become implicated in a deferential semiotics in which meaning resides in the self but is not owned by it. Through this work, women engage with an on-going project of visibility and objectification that is often tenuous and difficult but is nevertheless compelling, as they seek to mediate the agency of God.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1042990,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
162,"Being Tamil, being Hindu: Tamil migrants’ negotiations of the absence of Tamil Hindu spaces in the West Midlands and South West of England","This paper considers the religious practices of Tamil Hindus who have settled in the West Midlands and South West of England in order to explore how devotees of a specific ethno-regional Hindu tradition with a well-established UK infrastructure in the site of its adherents’ population density adapt their religious practices in settlement areas which lack this infrastructure. Unlike the majority of the UK Tamil population who live in the London area, the participants in this study did not have ready access to an ethno-religious infrastructure of Tamil-orientated temples1 and public rituals. The paper examines two means by which this absence was addressed as well as the intersections and negotiations of religion and ethnicity these entailed: firstly, Tamil Hindus’ attendance of temples in their local area which are orientated towards a broadly imagined Hindu constituency or which cater to a non-Tamil ethno-linguistic or sectarian community; and, secondly, through the ‘DIY’ performance of ethnicised Hindu ritual in non-institutional settings.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1027968,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
163,Clarifying phenomenologies in the study of religion: separating Kristensen and van der Leeuw from Otto and Eliade,"One of the most difficult aspects of trying to understand ‘phenomenology' in the study of religion is that proponent and opponent alike cannot seem to agree on what the title actually entails. Yet despite an insistence that ‘phenomenology' does not refer to a monolithic tradition, many scholars still write as if it is, subsuming a range of contradictory figures under the rubric. It is the argument of this paper that Kristensen and van der Leeuw have been victims of this ‘Tyranny of the Same' which has occluded their methodological value. By questioning their relation to Rudolf Otto and Mircea Eliade – common representatives of ‘phenomenology of religion' – the author will argue that each pair represents a different tradition: typological phenomenology and phenomenological history-of-religion. Their erroneous connection, the author argues, has been the product of a third, synthetic tradition: phenomenology-of-religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1057773,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-46
164,The institutional evolution of religion: innovation and entrepreneurship in ancient Israel,"In light of contemporary advances and in an effort to supplement and add to the vibrant discourse surrounding the evolution of religion, a distinctly sociological theory that returns to and pushes forward the insights of Durkheim and Weber is offered. The unit of evolution is the institutional sphere, or the macro-level structural and cultural sphere of religious action, exchange, and communication; and evolution is the process by which religious entrepreneurs are able to secure material and symbolic independence vis-à-vis other strata and, thereby, carve out an autonomous religious institution to reproduce their symbolic, normative, and organizational innovations. To illustrate the way this sociological theory of institutional evolution works, and how it accounts for multi-linear evolutionary paths, while considering contingencies, the evolution of the Ancient Israelite religion from the late 8th century BCE to the end of the Exile in the late 6th century BCE is examined.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1009864,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
165,Directly perceiving Kṛṣṇa: Accounting for perceptual experiences of deities within the framework of naturalism,"Using descriptions found in Viśvanātha Cakravārtin's Mādhurya Kādambinī (c.17th century) as a case study, the author argues in this article that research in the psychological sciences offers a plausible account within the framework of naturalism for the occurrence of private perceptual experiences that can serve as a basis for what Viśvanātha and other early Gauḍīya theologians describe and appraise as direct perceptual experiences (sākṣātkāra) of Kṛṣṇa. The purpose of this investigation is to bridge the methodological divide that often separates the humanities and sciences and facilitate a richer interpretation and explanation of historical claims than what is usually available through traditional humanistic approaches alone. The results of this research have implications for the study of private perceptual experiences of deities across cultures in both historical and contemporary contexts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1009863,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
166,Buddhist meditation in Britain: 1853 and 1945,"Discussions about Buddhist meditation in the West usually focus on the post-1960s period and explain the popularity of meditation in a context of modernistic discourses. In this article the author suggests that meditation was in fact available in Britain much earlier than is usually assumed, in a period which was without doubt ‘modern,' yet which did not quickly produce mass acceptance of meditative practices in its host culture. While the migration of meditation was influenced by modernist discourses, these were sometimes contradictory to each other and hindered acceptance. The author examines how the term meditation itself has evolved, who first brought it to Britain and why, as well as the political and social forces that shaped its trajectory of acceptance and rejection in the first half of the 20th century.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1027969,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45

169,Religious individualisation in historical perspective,"This article introduces a special issue of Religion which proposes a new, historical and comparative engagement with processes of religious individualisation. Building on the critique of theories of modernisation the proposition is to trace the variety of forms of individualisation as found in various world regions during different time periods. Together with a particular orientation for the study of religion this represents a shift in social theorising. It puts the experiences and activities of individuals centre stage and foregrounds situation, context and contingency. Accentuating interactional and micro-social dimensions, however, does not mean excluding macro- and long-term perspectives. At the centre of attention are constellations in which the individual personality becomes a defining feature for at least certain sections of society. In addition, the approach allows the capturing of paradoxical constellations. In order to secure individuality, individualisation is turned into a norm or even becomes stereotyped. Our approach allows us to address such trends that counter and sometimes block and reverse individualising developments. The special issue of Religion presents examples of a complex research arena that is still evolving. Besides two conceptual papers the special edition covers examples from various phases of Indian and European religious history as well as from the modern period in both regions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1041795,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
170,Processes of religious individualisation: stocktaking and issues for the future,"The paper spells out implications of a perspective on religious individualisation that is both comparative and analytical and discusses the various issues that this line of research has to confront. Arguing against notions of modern Western exceptionalism, it points to the selectivity of Western forms of (religious) individualisation and makes a case for the inclusion of additional forms of articulating individual agency and ‘selfhood'. The paper takes individualisation as an inter-subjective, social phenomenon and connects it to the concept of social imaginaries. Opposing standard concepts of modernisation the paper nevertheless brings processuality centre stage, emphasising contingency. The paper discusses the possibility of the convergence of contextual developmental trends and the question of transculturality of notions of self and agency. With reference to the dimension of critique included in visions of religious individualisation, the paper finally points to the effects processes of religious individualisation can have on human actors within, and beyond, the realm of spirituality, including the recognition of subjectivities and the strengthening of actors’ resilience.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1024035,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
171,"Religious agency, identity, and communication: reflections on history and theory of religion","This paper discusses the applicability of recent theories of religion to the problem of describing and explaining religious transformation in the period between the final Bronze Age and Late Antiquity. Instead of evolutionist and cognitive approaches, it proposes a model of religion that tries to analyze religion in terms of its making by starting from the individual's appropriation and creation of religious tradition. Religion is understood as a strategy to attribute agency to agents that do not appear immediately plausible. Recent scholarly discussions on human agency suggest categorizing human religious agency into the three subsets, namely: (1) acting religiously with regards to past, present, and future; (2) collective religious identity; and (3) religious communication. These subsets are shown to produce fruitful questions for research on historical sources. Against this backdrop, religion is explained as a precarious cultural resource articulated through the agency of individuals and allowing changed attributions of individual agency.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1024040,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
172,Religious competence and individuality: three studies in the Roman Empire,"The theme of individuality and individualisation in religious contexts in the fairly remote past is perhaps best viewed as a heuristic device whose main value, at least in the context of Graeco-Roman history, is to question the excessive dominance of a model of religious action as essentially collective, which is perhaps proximately Durkheimian but in the Classical field goes back ultimately to early scholarship on ancient Judaism. Terminology is a basic problem in this context. Religious individuality can be defined as the construction of personal religious achievement or the practice of mastery defined by sui generis rules. In the case of the Roman Empire, five types of such achievement have been suggested: pragmatic; moral; competitive; representative; or exemplary/ reflexive. All these distinguishable types of individuality are linked, at least indirectly, to the complex and highly differentiated social, political, economic and moral structures of the Empire. Specifically religious individuation emerges only with the development of religion as a distinctive field of (social) action and thus the possibility of specifically religious distinction. If sustained over the long term, any such achievement is to be seen as individualisation under ancient conditions. This article briefly explores three types of religious distinction based on a conviction and lived practice of such individualised competence: the figure of the Weberian mystagogue in his Mediterranean forms; the figure of the practitioner skilled in Graeco-Egyptian ‘magic’; and the idealised figure of Pythagoras as projected by Iamblichus’ On the Pythagorean life (c.300 CE).",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1024036,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
173,Religious pluralism and processes of individualisation in Hinduism,"The paper explores the interconnection between religious pluralisation and processes of individualisation in India by focusing on the emergence of religious alternatives to Vedic ritualism in the centuries around the beginning of the Common Era. Criticism of established religious goals and practices voiced by individuals was accompanied by an increasing interest in the structures of individual existence. The conceptualisation of the individual in the philosophical and religious literature of the period is an important aspect of establishing new religious pathways with ideas of self, agency and personal relatedness being of central concern. On the basis of different doctrines religious options gained acceptance which allow individuals to pursue their religious aspirations either apart from or parallel to the ritual-social obligations in the context of caste-hierarchy. The new religious options gravitate towards institutionalisation in the form of religious communities (sampradāya). These are not only important elements in organising Hindu religious pluralism, but also allow for recurrent processes of religious individualisation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1024038,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
174,How individual was conscience in the early-modern period? Observations on the development of Catholic moral theology,"This article investigates how the notion of individual conscience has to be understood within the early-modern development of Catholic moral theology. It highlights that 16th-century Catholic theologians continued to understand conscience mainly in Thomist terms as a rational judgment. Yet they also came to investigate more deeply questions of intention and individual circumstances that might interfere with the perfect execution of moral reasoning. Particular emphasis is given to the question of probabilism and whether this new method of analyzing moral agency provided a stepping stone towards a more individualized conception of conscience, as some intellectual historians have contended. The article argues that whilst probabilism sharpened the awareness for problems of conscience, this development cannot be disconnected from the culture of counsel of conscience, inscribed into the fundamentally Thomist definition of it.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1024039,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
175,Between acculturation and self-assertion: individualisation in the German-Jewish context of the German Empire and the Weimar Republic and its contribution to the development of modern sociology,"Using the example of four German-Jewish scholars of the 19th and 20th centuries – Moritz Lazarus (1824–1903), Hermann Cohen (1842–1918), Georg Simmel (1858–1918) and Alfred Schütz (1899–1959), who all maintained intense connections to their Jewish backgrounds – this article aims to illustrate that Jewish traditions held favourable conditions for processes of religious and social individualisation. The focus of the analysis is placed on the figure of the stranger, a theme all four authors dealt with in their work. On the one hand they investigated the stranger as a biblical figure with social-ethical implications (Lazarus and Cohen); on the other, they developed a sociological approach by analysing the role of the stranger in the construction of society (Schütz and Simmel). This article strives to illustrate how a particular religious ideal – the commandment of love for one's neighbour and the recognition of the stranger as a fellowman – has been transformed into a sociological concept for the promotion of individuality. Reconstructing this context also means exploring the history of sociology as a scientific discipline in Germany and to look into the attempts of sociologists to understand otherness in the multicultural societies of the 21st century.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1024041,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
176,Approaching the rasa-lila of ‘great men': interlinking Western ‘intuitive’ theologies with traditions of Bengal in the Brahmo Samaj,"Among contemporary sociologists who critically analyze the specific structure and dynamics of current or ‘late-modern’ societies, it is very common to refer to processes of increasing individualization as an explanation for larger social trends. Presuming a Protestant Christian genealogy for processes of individualization they tend to underemphasize the extent to which modern constellations are indebted in various ways to imperialism and the colonial encounter. To approach the complicated issue of encounter and mutual interferences, first an understanding of the categories involved in the interaction from within the traditions of the colonized is necessary. Only then will we be able to determine the way in which concepts of the colonizers were interpreted, understood, and appropriated. This essay aims to show that links were drawn between the global discourse on an experiential approach to religion, emphasizing the ‘Self,' and regional Vaishnava bhakti traditions of Bengal in the Bharatbarsiya Brahmo Samaj. This phase of increasing religious individualization with its focus on reliance on the ‘Self’ also contributed to preparing the ground for nationalistic readings of Indian traditions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2015.1024037,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
177,‘Africa always brings us something new’: a historiography of African Zionist and Pentecostal Christianities,"This article outlines and interrogates the historiography, major debates, critical works, and typological disputes in the study of African Zionist and African Pentecostal Christianities. We contend that despite the many valid historiographic and typological critiques advanced in recent decades, the categories of Zionist and Pentecostal continue to retain validity and utility to scholars and practitioners alike.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.992110,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
178,The Zion Christian Church and Global Christianity: negotiating a tightrope between localisation and globalisation,"South Africa's Zion Christian Church (ZCC) is a primary example of African Indigenous Christianity. This article discusses some of the ways in which a church such as the ZCC might be simultaneously understood as a localised indigenous group, a ‘constructed indigeneity’, as well as inherently belonging to a wider historical tradition of Global Christianity. The discussion proceeds alongside a critical engagement of the sociologist Robert Wuthnow's deconstruction of the ‘Global Christianity Paradigm’, as well as an appropriation of the phenomenologist of religion, James Cox's depiction of ‘indigenous religions’ as an empirically viable theoretical concept, which is demonstrated here as also useful for the purpose of elucidating the type of religiosity encountered in the ZCC. The article makes a plea for a wider acknowledgment of the value of normative approaches to the study of African Christianity and refers to the cultural impact of the theological idea of Incarnation to explain why.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.992111,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
179,Decolonising the word: Themba Masinga and his religious poetry in Ibandla LamaNazaretha,"Themba Masinga is one of the most prominent praise poets in Ibandla lamaNazaretha of Ebuhleni. He has composed a number of praise poems especially for Uthingo (MV Shembe) and the present leader, Unyazi (M Shembe). However, Masinga has also composed and performed poems that reflect on his identity as a member of Ibandla lamaNazaretha. Masinga's religious poetry borrows from a number of genres including praise poetry, sermon performance, story-telling and modern poetry. Masinga's poems are shot through with biblical references, and this article examines the ways in which he appropriates the Bible in his poetry. The author suggests that Masinga's reading of the Bible defies a simplistic understanding of the Bible as the word of God. His use of the Bible is quite complex because at one point he rejects it as a foreign text, but uses it to support his claims. He appropriates the Bible for his purposes, and uses it to define his identity as a member of Ibandla lamaNazaretha.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.992109,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
180,Four ways into an African sacred wilderness: a study of Johane Masowe's teaching,"This article focuses on four ways of explaining the term masowe in relation to the founder figure, Johane Masowe (1914–1973). First, the term refers to a liminal place or threshold for divine intervention. Johane Masowe claims authority as a prophet by making inexplicit yet obvious references to biblical stories about a sacred wilderness. Second, the term masowe draws attention to problems of displacement caused by colonialism and postcolonial oppression in Zimbabwe. Third, stories told by Johane Masowe's devotees about the near-death experiences of the prophet turned masowe into a dangerous place wherein Satan-the-Witch caused suffering and death. Although the fourth meaning is yet to be examined more closely, it comes from Masowe Apostles who travel from as far away as Nairobi, Kenya, on pilgrimage to Johane Masowe's burial shrine in Zimbabwe, thereby hinting at hopes for redemption in the form of life after death.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.992107,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
181,"Prophets, evangelists, and missionaries: Trans-Atlantic interactions in the emergence of Nigerian Pentecostalism","This article historicizes the contemporary Pentecostal movement in Nigeria by examining relationships between Nigerian prophets, British missionaries, and American evangelists in the 1930s and 1940s. First, the article challenges assumptions about the genealogy and chronology of Nigerian Pentecostalism by taking a close look at the beginnings of the Christ Apostolic Church. Then, it discusses new evidence which reveals the surprising influence of a marginal American evangelist and renegade British missionary on the church's doctrine. Making use of a wide range of evidence from Nigerian, Welsh, and American archives, the article argues that while the Aladura movement may have had indigenous origins, its development made significant use of foreign support and did so much earlier than has been appreciated by previous studies. The larger significance of this argument is that it shows the mutual constitution of American, British, and Nigerian Pentecostalism; instead of emerging first in the US and UK and then being taken to Africa, Pentecostalism's development across the Atlantic was coeval.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.992108,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
182,Zionism and Aladura's shared genealogy in John Alexander Dowie,"In this article, the author historically describes the process by which Faith Tabernacle Congregation was established by an Evangelist (and later Overseer) in John Alexander Dowie's Christian Catholic Church in Zion. He then explains the similarity of both churches' African missions – the Christian Catholic Church in South Africa and Faith Tabernacle in Nigeria. Both American churches, with a distinct genealogical relationship to one another, significantly affected very similar Christian movements, which were the Zionist movement in South Africa and the Aladura movement in Nigeria. Both of these movements are frequently credited with institutionalizing divine healing within African Christianity, and many scholars argue that African Pentecostalism begin within these movements. In the conclusion, the author reflects historiographically on this relationship: the Christian Catholic Church to Faith Tabernacle and particularly Zionism to Aladura. He argues that the historical relatedness between the two churches challenges the generally held notion that healing in African Christianity is only an expression or continuity of a ‘primal African religiosity.’ The Christian Catholic Church in South Africa and Faith Tabernacle in Nigeria did not represent the conjoining of opposing cultural forms, as in discussions of syncretism, but the hybridizing of very similar religious beliefs and practices with respect to disease, health, and healing.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.992105,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
183,Men of God: Neo-Pentecostalism and masculinities in urban Tanzania,"Based on research in Tanzania, this article explores how masculine born-again Christian identities are constructed and enacted in a field of tension between Pentecostal/charismatic norms for masculine behaviour and popular cultural expectations of male honour and status. The author sheds light on the gendered aspects of conversion and highlights why becoming a born-again Christian often represents a different kind of challenge and a more radical change of lifestyle in the case of men. At the same time, the author argues that a thorough understanding of the ways in which born-again men negotiate identities and position themselves in the social world they live in requires that we move beyond the narrow focus on the oppositional aspects of born-again masculinities that characterises much of the literature on Pentecostal/charismatic Christianity and gender. Focusing particular attention on the recent neo-Pentecostal turn in Tanzania (and Africa), the article demonstrates how this kind of Christianity allows for transformations in private while at the same time providing room for the enactment of powerful masculine identities in public.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.997433,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
184,Egalitarianism and hierarchy in Copperbelt religious practice: on the social work of Pentecostal ritual,"This article offers an analysis of Pentecostal ritual life focused on a core tension in this religion, namely that between the egalitarianism associated with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on all believers and the hierarchy that follows from the charismatic authority of church leaders. Drawing on ethnographic material from the Zambian Copperbelt, the author traces out the egalitarian and hierarchical aspects of Pentecostal ritual in order to demonstrate the importance of both of these elements to the social relationships that Pentecostal adherence produces. While the tension between egalitarianism and hierarchy is evident in all Pentecostal groups, on the Copperbelt their interaction produces social results which build on extant cultural models, and which have particular significance in the light of Zambia's recent economic history. These local resonances in turn allow us to address discontinuity, a central topic in analyses of Pentecostalism, as well as the role of creativity in ritual practice.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.992106,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
185,For a secular return to the sacred: Raffaele Pettazzoni's last statement on the name of the science of religions,"In 1959, the president of the International Association for the History of Religions, Raffaele Pettazzoni, wrote the last notes of his life. Among these documents, there is a group of unpublished remarks: an attempt to outline the possible task of a unified study of religion, bridging the two dimensions – historical and phenomenological – as two facets of a single and general science of religions named ‘sacrology’. Pettazzoni had this new name in mind to meet the challenge of the Conference called by the IAHR at Marburg (1960). The questions raised in this essay – which deal with the discipline's nature and with its programme – let us see the symptoms of the Italian storicisti's interest within the framework of the problems connected with the controversial notion of sacred.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.918060,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
186,Reassembling religious symbols: the Pagan God Baphomet,"Religious symbols are primarily significant because they draw people into relationships. Drawing on actor-network theory the paper demonstrates that symbols are hybrids of beliefs, cognitive interpretations, ritual performances and relational networks. The significance of symbols is located in this middle ground, as they mediate between thought and action, as well as between interpretative meaning and relational practice. Aesthetic experiences and ritual performance are interwoven with cognitive meaning and representation to generate the impact of religious symbols. This understanding of symbols is illustrated through an ethnographic account of a Pagan ritual involving the deity Baphomet. One of the participants describes this ritual succinctly: ‘Baphomet is a recreation of the Witches’ sabbat, an invocation of archetypal Witchcraft. It's R-rated, it contains adult themes, nudity and sex references.’ Through ritual experiences, religious symbols change the way people feel about themselves, the world and the people around them.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.949898,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
187,Born-again seeking: explaining the gentile majority in messianic Judaism,"Messianic Judaism is an American-born movement of congregations that hold evangelical beliefs and follow Jewish practices. Scholars have viewed it chiefly as a new religious movement (NRM) or a controversial branch of Judaism. As a result, they have downplayed or ignored its largely evangelical Christian base. The first study of ‘gentile believers,’ this article argues that Messianic Judaism is best understood through the lens of religious seeking, a trend usually associated with alternative spiritualities and still under-theorized vis-à-vis conservative Christians, like evangelicals. First, it traces why Messianic Judaism appeals to growing numbers of North American Christians. Second, and more broadly, it argues that seeking is a spiritually satisfying religious practice that, for evangelicals, reiterates central themes of born-again life. Their experiences also clarify the limits that may constrain religious seeking; they seek to deepen and actualize a biblical worldview in religious sites viewed as proximate to their own.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.949899,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
188,Astounding history: L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology space opera,"L. Ron Hubbard created in Scientology an immense landscape of alternative worlds, realities, and possibilities. Scientology cosmology, mythology, and eschatology are inescapably linked to galactic events and Hubbard's retelling of human history is replete with science-fiction tropes – many of which found popularity in the early science-fiction tradition to which he belonged. In his therapeutic and religious teachings, Hubbard proposed a complex narrative that re-defined the essence of self and society in relation to the cosmos. For Scientologists, the fantastic becomes mundane as they position themselves within a vast and heavy quest to reshape themselves, the rest of humanity, and, for some, the entire universe. Understood within the science-fiction context from which Scientology emerged, one can better understand the grand nature of Hubbard's proposals as belonging to a specific tradition within the genre – namely, space opera. Consequently, this article analyses Hubbard's propositions using space-opera concepts, and argues that Hubbard re-defined a unique tradition in the course of creating a new reality.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.957746,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
189,Remembering Karbala in the diaspora: religious rituals among Iraqi Shii women in Ireland,"Memory studies have gained much popularity in the humanities and social sciences since the 1980s. Particularly after the seminal work of Danièle Hervieu-Léger on ‘religion as a chain of memory’, discussions arose around how theories of memory can be applied in the Study of Religions. Few scholars, however, have discussed the intersection between religion, particularly Islam, and memory. In this article, the focus lies on Shii Muslim communities in Ireland, for whom remembering constitutes an important part of their identity and legitimises their particular sectarian existence within Islam in general. This article discusses Iraqi Shii women's engagement in ‘collective remembering’ (Paul Connerton, How Societies Remember, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989; J.V. Wertsch, Voices of Collective Remembering, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) expressed through constantly performed religious rituals and practices.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.965770,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-45
190,"‘Goblins, owles and sprites’: Discerning early-modern English preternatural beings through collocational analysis","Using the tools of collocational analysis, we explore the distribution and lexical relations of fairy, goblin, imp, and cognate terms within a corpus of approximately 17.6 million words of early-modern English. We found that imp, incubus, and familiar have well-circumscribed associations and are restricted to specific genres. However, goblin and fairy often appear in definitional or synonymizing phrases (e.g., ‘the fairies are spirits’), or, in contrast, are used in ‘indiscriminate pairings’ (e.g., ‘ghosts and goblins’) that serve to index a twilight domain of the spooky, the eerie, the unknown. We argue that the study of such preternatural beings is properly the study of rhetorical patterns. Goblins and their kin function as sites of contestation about other definitional schema: superstition, religion, magic.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.886631,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
191,"Religion's ‘state effects’: Evangelical Christianity, political legitimacy, and state formation","The author argues in this paper that the ‘state effects’ generated by religious movements – even those operating at the margins of societies – require us to consider anew the impact of religious movements on state formation. In Sri Lanka, for instance, evangelicals are a minority. Yet their practice of proselytizing to new audiences was considered ‘unethical,’ generating opposition that was directed not only at them, but also at ruling elites for failing to stem what was seen as an intrusion of incompatible ‘Western’ ideals. Instead of considering how such Christian movements seek to ‘take over’ the functions of the ‘state’ as has been the experience in the United States and parts of Latin America, the author illustrates in this article why it makes more theoretical sense to ask how their activities impinge upon the conceptual frameworks through which the ‘state’ is imagined.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.894951,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
192,Measuring religious affiliation in Great Britain: the 2011 census in historical and methodological context,"The British religious census of 2011 is located in its broader historical and methodological context. The principal developments in the measurement of religious affiliation (proxy-assigned or self-assigned) in Britain are traced from the Reformation to the present day, charting the relative contribution of the Churches, the State and empirical social science. The key statistics which have emerged from their respective efforts are summarised, with nominal religious affiliation universal until the time of the French Revolution and preponderant until as late as the 1980s. For recent decades, when the profession of faith has been rejected by large numbers of Britons, particular attention is paid to the variant results from different question-wording. Depending upon what is asked, the proportion of the population currently making sense of their lives without asserting a confessional religious identity ranges from one-quarter to one-half. The difficulties of trying to construct a religious barometer through a single, unitary indicator are thus illuminated.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.903643,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
193,Filling a data gap: the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) series,"The last US government survey that collected information on religious identification was in 1957. Since then researchers have relied solely on non-governmental data sources, primarily the General Social Survey. This paper shows how the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) series has deepened understanding of religious identification in the past two decades with its large samples (113 713 in 1990, 50 280 in 2001, and 54 461 in 2008) and its unique open-ended religion question. Giving respondents a chance to name their own religion, if any, allows researchers to identify and study small religious groups, which are placed together under ‘other’ in typical national studies. By using a consistent research methodology, the ARIS surveys form a time-series that enable tracking trends. The paper describes two case studies: how the ARIS series documented the rise of the Nones and how it tracked shifts in religious identification among American Latinos.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.903648,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44

195,Minority religions in the census: the case of British Muslims,"This article considers the impact of census data on British Muslims, as well as the potential consequences of changes to the UK census beyond 2011 for minority religions. Focusing on the Muslim case, it reflects on data generated in previous censuses and the ways in which they have been used. The discussion explores the perceived need for social statistics on religion, particularly in relation to the increased identification of ‘Muslim’ as a religious rather than ethnic classification. It gives an overview of insights gained as a result of having data on religion in addition to ethnicity, notably: the high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage experienced by British Muslims and the ability to access information on Muslims that was hitherto hidden. Finally, the article provides a brief summary of proposed changes to the new census format and considers the likely outcomes for British Muslims if the scope of data collected on religion is reduced.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.927049,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
196,Using census data in the management of religious diversity: an Australian case study,"Mapping and measuring religious diversity has become critical to the management of interreligious relations in the 21st century. The data about religious identification provided by the Australian census since the formation of Federal Government in Australia, and prior to that in the Colonies, has provided detailed information about the extent of and changes in religious diversity in the nation and in particular cities. Because the census also provides very detailed information about where people of different religions live, it can provide information about the extent to which religious groups are residentially segregated, a factor which affects how people of different religions relate to each other. The methodological issues related to measuring diversity are discussed and the utility in urban contexts of a ‘dissimilarity scale’ is demonstrated. The unique contribution of census data to the mapping and management of religious diversity in Australia is presented.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.903639,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
197,Evidencing superdiversity in the census and beyond,"Starting from the proposition, in both my own work and that of Steve Vertovec, that there is something about superdiverse neighbourhoods or societies that is qualitatively different from those that are merely diverse, this paper asks whether it is possible to identify religious superdiversity within quantitative population data, such as the census in England and Wales, in order to test such a proposition. In doing this the paper will ask whether it is possible to find any evidence for superdiversity, as Vertovec defines it, in data sets such as the census and whether such data can help to identify where to set the boundary between ‘diversity’ and ‘superdiversity’. The paper will then explore what would need to be measured in order to designate an area as superdiverse in religious terms and whether the census data can offer any material that can be used for this purpose. The author concludes by suggesting that we need a range of methods, both quantitative and qualitative, to define any area as superdiverse and that it is only in this way that we can begin to test the kind of hypothesis offered by the author at the start of the paper.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.903649,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
198,Secular or nonreligious? Investigating and interpreting generic ‘not religious’ categories and populations,"In research dealing with religious affiliation, generic nonreligious categories – ‘no religion’, ‘not religious’, ‘nonreligious’, ‘nones’ – are frequently used to measure secularity and secularisation processes. Analysis of these categories is, however, problematic because they have not received dedicated methodological attention. Using qualitative research conducted in the UK, this article investigates what nonreligious categories measure and, specifically, whether they indicate non-identification or disaffiliation as assumed or an alternative form of cultural affiliation. Findings suggest that generic nonreligious categories are sometimes used to express substantive positions and public identities, and that these are diverse. These findings flatten distinctions between religious and nonreligious categories as ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ respectively and indicate problems therefore in using nonreligious identification to measure secularity and secularisation. They suggest nonreligious identification is, however, a useful indicator of the advance of nonreligious cultures and the ‘nonreligionisation’ of societies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.904035,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
199,Standing up to be counted: understanding Pagan responses to the 2011 British censuses,"Over the past 50 years, Paganism as a religious identification has grown in Britain and Pagan groups have begun to enter the mainstream of public religious life. The numbers identifying as Pagan increased between the 2001 and 2011 British censuses, but despite Paganism's increased public profile not all Pagans feel willing or confident about openly declaring their Paganism. Census numbers fall well below estimates from other sources. In May 2013, a questionnaire was distributed to Pagans in Britain exploring how they completed the religion question in the 2011 censuses. Some 1700 responded, the largest survey so far of the Pagan community in Britain. This paper discusses Pagans' motivations for identifying or not identifying as Pagan in the censuses and the implications of their responses for the development of Paganism in Britain. More widely, it provides a case study for those seeking to understand the increasing phenomenon in contemporary societies of religious and spiritual communities that are unstructured, amorphous and post-institutional. It demonstrates that censuses and large-scale surveys can become social and community events that shape as well as measure those who participate in them.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.903640,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
200,Religion: Not declining but changing. What do the population censuses and surveys say about religion in Estonia?,"This paper investigates religious affiliation in Estonia, considered to be one of the most secularized countries in the world and in which less than one third of the population affiliates with a religion on population censuses. Firstly, the article scrutinizes these data methodologically, comparing census results with findings from other survey and opinion polls. It finds that census data correlate with those from face-to-face surveys, while postal surveys tend to show considerably higher rates of religiosity and affiliation. Secondly, the article considers the findings themselves. According to census data, 29 percent of the population remained religiously affiliated between 2000 and 2011. However, the census also captures interesting changes over that period that illuminate the situation further. Significantly, Estonia is the first European country in which the traditional majority church has been usurped by a denomination associated with the largest ethnic minority group and which makes a strong connection between cultural and national identities. The article places this finding in the context of Central and Eastern European census data to argue that religious affiliation tends to remain high in societies where religious and national or ethnic identities have close ties, whereas traditional denominations have been declining in societies where these kinds of connections are weak. This factor helps explain variation between experiences of religious change in post-Socialist contexts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.914635,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
201,From the body: an exchange on scholarship and advocacy,"In this article, the authors draw from their own experiences working among religious congregations that minister to unauthorized immigrants in the new destinations in the U.S. to reflect on the relationship between scholarship and advocacy. They argue that because of the scholar's embodied condition, his/her location in networks of relations characterized by power differentials, scholarship will always involve a measure of advocacy, invariably containing judgments not only about what counts as legitimate and authoritative methods, arguments, and data for the religious-studies scholarly ‘community,’ but also about the place of the scholar and her/his scholarly community in the larger society. However, as their own experiences show, not all forms of advocacy are equal – they vary in their level of publicness, as well as the intensity and type of the engagement – and these various modalities carry potential payoffs and pitfalls. Thus, rather than trying to draw fixed, sharp, and ultimately untenable boundaries between scholarship and advocacy, the task is to develop a reflexive, pragmatic, and experimental attitude that can allow for these two dimensions of praxis to benefit from each other, animated by a critical approach and an emancipatory interest focused on the intractable problems and defining dilemmas of our age.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.888826,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
202,Doing advocacy from a feminist standpoint,"Feminist Standpoint theory contends that all research is partial, located, and interested. It argues that research should start from the standpoint of the disadvantaged and work toward social change. Following a brief exploration of the perspective, this article explores some of the ways that feminists pursue advocacy. The article reviews two methodological approaches employed by Feminist Standpoint researchers: Community Action Research and Institutional Ethnography. Turning to examine the work of several feminist scholars who study religion, we see that there is no one way that they do advocacy. There is considerable variation in choice of subject (who feminists advocate for) and audience (who feminists advocate to), as well as in the forms that advocacy takes. Finally, the article suggests that for these scholars of religion, being an advocate is an important identity that they bring to their work.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.888036,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
203,Woven together: advocacy and research as complementary,"One of the many important contributions of second-wave feminist scholarship was the re-positioning of scholarly activity as being necessarily situated in relation to ‘I.’ This insistence on standpoint, or positionality, was coupled with a contribution from postmodernism, which challenged the notion that (universal) truths could circulate without specific attachments to people and places. Advocacy was a less used word, but the position taken in this paper is that every piece of research, in all science, carries with it the potential for advocacy. Drawing on the author's own experiences of advocacy as interwoven though her career as a lawyer and an academic, this paper examines various aspects of the intersection of advocacy and professional work.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.887994,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
204,"Off the stage, on the page: on the relationship between advocacy and scholarship","When and how should scholars of religion draw a line between advocacy and research activities? In what ways does advocacy contribute to or cut against scholarly credibility? Addressing these questions from the intersection of the academic study of religion and Indigenous Studies, this article opens by asserting that both fields are frequently hampered by deferential treatments of their subject matter, a problem that is potentially exacerbated when scholars in these fields engage in forms of political advocacy. Problematizing this narrative, the author turns to his ethnographic experiences in Hawai'i with regard to burial-protection struggles in order to describe ways his theoretical commitments and advocacy activities stand in tension and how he has attempted to navigate these competing but sometimes complementary elements of his scholarly life. In this context, a heuristic definition of advocacy is advanced in order to sketch a spectrum of forms, ranging from direct advocacy (e.g., physical action, legal testimony, or publication) to indirect advocacy (e.g., sharing documents, brainstorming about pending issues, or providing transportation to a meeting). The article concludes with reflections on advocacy and changing institutional demands upon scholars in the humanities and social sciences with reference to perceived public relevance.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.888027,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
205,"Advocacy, brainwashing theories, and new religious movements","Advocacy by scholars in the field of new religious movements emerged during the ‘cult wars,’ which in the U.S. had their peak between 1970 and 1990 and continued in Europe and Japan in subsequent decades. Advocacy focused on the question of whether the ‘cults’ used a persuasion technique known as brainwashing. The idea of brainwashing was born during the Cold War, and originally applied to Communist techniques of indoctrination, but was lately first extended to religion and subsequently used as a tool to distinguish between legitimate and non-legitimate religions, labeling the latter as ‘cults.’ Prominent psychologists and sociologists were involved in these battles, with most scholars of new religious movements appearing in court in order to criticize the brainwashing theories advocated by psychologist Margaret T. Singer and a handful of anti-cult academics. After the Fishman decision of 1990, which seriously hit the anti-cult camp, advocacy in this field did not disappear but became somewhat less partisan.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2014.888021,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
206,What can we say about today's British religious young person? Findings from the AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme,"Since the late 20th century, research linking youth and religion has begun to grow. Such growth has been given a particular boost in the UK by the AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme. This article addresses what we can say about today's British religious young person through review of new research findings from the Programme. One certainly can no longer assume that a British religious young person is a practising Christian. He or she is likely to engage with a range of offline and online resources in order to learn more about their faith, and feel some tensions between their commitments and engagement with wider society. Social class and other factors will affect his or her capacity to engage with religion and civil society. Like their non-religious peers, today's British religious young person values relationships and authenticity. Tensions between structure and agency in our neoliberal age emerge through their stories.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.844740,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
207,"National piety: Religious equality, freedom of religion and national identity in Finnish political discourse","This paper analyses the legislative discourse regarding a Members' Initiative to enact a law which was discussed in the Finnish parliament in 2006 and which proposed changes to the constitution and several laws, the purpose of which was to balance the privileged position that the Lutheran Church of Finland enjoys. The author uses critical discourse analysis to examine four different discourses emerging from the debate: inequality of religions in the eyes of the law; the ‘completeness’ of the freedom of religion in Finland; the justified hegemony of the ‘folk church’; and the church as a value base in a pluralising world. He argues that the discursive struggle between the different positions is a struggle between ‘minimalist’ and ‘maximalist’ definitions of freedom of religion and that the discussion represents a case of ‘national piety’, a conflation of discourses of religious equality, freedom of religion and national identity that reproduces the status quo.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.857366,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
208,"‘Here's your dinner, Jews’: Yemenite-Jewish lamentation in Israel as a commemoration of shame","A covert reason for the decline of ritual wailing among Yemenite-Jewish women in Israel is the community's memory of its stay in Yemen as a period of ‘exile’ manifested in dhimmi status. According to respondents’ oral history, Jewish lamentation was exploited by members of the majority Muslim population to compel Jews – mostly men – to wail in honor of Muslim dead. The article makes its main contribution by revealing this historical episode and analyzing the standing of women's lamentation in the context of religio-political tension. The respondents' narrative reveals that although the wailers mitigated the humiliating effects of this spectacle, the appropriation of their community custom impaired Jewish men's gender status and ability to perform religious differentiation. This, coupled with changes caused by their relocation to Israel, has made women's lament the commemoration of a practice that evokes shame among members of this community, abetting its decline in the past decade.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.841111,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
209,Three cognitive routes to atheism: a dual-process account,"According to recent cognitive explanations of religiosity, belief in supernatural agents is a result of species-universal cognitive modules operating in environments similar enough to those these modules evolved in. Less attention has been given to the cognitive basis of atheism. The author brings together three ways in which atheism could arise that are a priori compatible with recent cognitive explanations of religiosity. One way is reflective and involves the effortful overturning of unreflective modular cognition. The other two ways are unreflective and involve, firstly, the operation of modular cognition in evolutionarily novel environments, and secondly, developmental variation of modular cognition. The author argues that there is evidence for both a reflective route and at least one unreflective route to atheism, and that reflective and unreflective causes probably interact with each other. Consequently, he argues that the cognitive profiles of atheists are not necessarily more reflective than those of believers, nor any less ‘natural’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.841110,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-44
210,Checking the heavenly ‘bank account of karma’: cognitive metaphors for karma in Western perception and early Theravāda Buddhism,"To visualize the accumulation of good and bad karma in terms of credit or debt in a bank account is a common feature in works on Buddhism and other Indian traditions. Applying conceptual metaphor theory, this article tracks the metaphorical framework of understanding karma as a kind of ‘heavenly bank account’ back to its roots in early European scholarship. Based on a comparison with metaphors for karma to be found in Pāli texts of the Theravāda tradition, namely, the analogies of ripening, inheritance, and the dark/bright dichotomy, this article argues that the ‘bank-account’ imagery differs in significant – if subtle – respects from these emic metaphors, displaying certain Judeo-Christian preconceptions of moral bookkeeping, sin, and salvation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.765630,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
211,"Karma accounts: supplementary thoughts on Theravāda, Madhyamaka, theosophy, and Protestant Buddhism","This article supplements Jens Schlieter's discussion of the cognitive metaphor of a karmic bank-account, adding selected points on karma monetary/fiscal metaphors as preserved chiefly in Pāli and Sanskrit sources. It explores various strands of the history of South Asian religions where distinct economic metaphors for karma come closer to the late ‘bank-account of karma’: i.e., the Vedic ‘three debts,’ a Hindu concept of God as accountant, the varieties of weighing the (mis)deeds, the Buddhist monastic status of debt and fiscal transactions, the equivalence of karma and debt as discussed by Madhyamaka thinkers, and others. While endorsing Schlieter's point, it also takes into account such modern Western sources as early theosophical discourse and ‘Protestant Buddhism.’",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.834213,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
212,Reconsidering the concept of theodicy in the context of the post-2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami,"Has the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake given rise to theodicy in Japan? This question would puzzle many scholars of religion for two major reasons. First, theodicy has generally been regarded as an outdated concept, and it is rare to see a lively discussion of it in today's academia except for in theology. Second, typical theodicean questions are unlikely to be asked publicly in Japan, where less than 2 percent of the population follow monotheistic traditions. Despite these assumptions, this article not only reports that ‘apparently’ theodicean public discourses have emerged since the 11 March earthquake, but also attempts to employ the typology of theodicy to analyze them in a thought-provoking and critical manner. It argues that the post-3/11 Japanese voices, which regard the disaster as a divine punishment, use a reverse logic of traditional Western theodicy. Rather than signaling a sudden turn to monotheism, the voices are inclined to imply nativism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.779614,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
213,"Gay rights, the devil and the end times: public religion and the enchantment of the homosexuality debate in Zambia","This article contributes to the understanding of the role of religion in the public and political controversies about homosexuality in Africa. As a case study it investigates the heated public debate in Zambia following a February 2012 visit by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who emphasised the need for the country to recognise the human rights of homosexuals. The focus is on a particular Christian discourse in this debate, in which the international pressure to recognise gay rights is considered a sign of the end times, and Ban Ki-moon, the UN and other international organisations are associated with the Antichrist and the Devil. Here, the debate about homosexuality becomes eschatologically enchanted through millennialist thought. Building on discussions about public religion and religion and politics in Africa, this article avoids popular explanations in terms of fundamentalist religion and African homophobia, but rather highlights the political significance of this discourse in a postcolonial African context.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.765631,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
214,Regina Jonas: forgetting and remembering the first female rabbi,"Regina Jonas (1902–44), who was ordained in Germany in 1935, is now widely recognised as the world's first female rabbi. However, for almost 50 years after her death at Auschwitz in 1944, she was given very little, if any, public recognition. Based on archival research, interviews and critical engagement with secondary literature, this paper investigates a range of explanations why Jonas was nearly lost to historiography. It also considers the circumstances of the rediscovery of this controversial figure in the early 1990s and explores how she is remembered today. This paper raises important issues in relation to historiography and the connection between processes of remembering, forgetting and identity formation, particularly in relation to the history of the ordination of female rabbis and the history of Jewish communities in Germany.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.789090,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
215,The time and place for prayer: evangelical urbanism and citywide prayer movements,"This article explores a recent trend in evangelical revivalism known as ‘citywide prayer,’ a movement organized around prayer networks and public rituals that highlight religious concerns deemed specific to cities and metropolitan regions. Building on research that includes ethnographic fieldwork in Knoxville, Tennessee, and focusing on the discourse and practical strategies of citywide prayer, the article argues that advocates of this movement promote a style of evangelical urbanism in which prayer serves as a key medium for reimagining one's sense of place, against the disorientation and alienation associated with urban life. Moreover, prayer is presented as a medium for marking time in non-secular terms, as is demonstrated in the use of technologies of religious discipline such as annotated prayer calendars, which invite participants to inhabit multiple coexisting temporalities. It is further suggested that when enacted this evangelical urbanism constitutes a form of urban praxis, enabling projects of emplacement that respond to larger forces that are seen otherwise to limit grassroots agency. Among the wider implications of this discussion is the observation that evangelical revivals, despite their well-known emphasis on individual salvation and millennialist fervor, are oriented toward and engaged with situated social realities of the ‘here and now,’ including the rhythms of daily life in modern cities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.798162,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
216,The metropolis and evangelical life: coherence and fragmentation in the ‘lost city of London’,"This article examines the interplay of different processes of cultural and subjective fragmentation experienced by conservative evangelical Anglicans, based on an ethnographic study of a congregation in central London. The author focuses on the evangelistic speaking practices of members of this church to explore how individuals negotiate contradictory norms of interaction as they move through different city spaces, and considers their response to tensions created by the demands of their workplace and their religious lives. Drawing on Georg Simmel's ‘The Metropolis and Mental Life’, the author argues that their faith provides a sense of coherence and unity that responds to experiences of cultural fragmentation characteristic of everyday life in the city, while simultaneously leading to a specific consciousness of moral fragmentation that is inherent to conservative evangelicalism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.798164,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
217,Redeeming the city: creating and traversing ‘London-Lagos’,"The authors focus on strategies and aesthetics of urban expansion in Lagos and London by members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. On the one hand, these two metropolises represent very different forms of urban governance and religious context. On the other, they are juxtaposed and conjoined in significant ways as believers seek to fulfill spiritual and economic aspirations. ‘London-Lagos’ becomes a stretched city space that is created but also traversed as members negotiate diasporic linkages in the remaking of their lives as both believers and urban citizens.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.798161,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
218,"The city as promised land: moral reasoning, evil, and the dark side of capitalism in Ukraine",The theological prescriptions of a believer's burden preached at a large non-denominational Charismatic megachurch in Ukraine involve transforming the city in which one lives into a promised land. The means to do so involve making money and using that money to create ‘blessings’ for others. The actions of a group of entrepreneurs associated with this megachurch who have put this theology into practice have led to cross-cutting indictments of evil. The controversy that ensued over the proper response of a believer to suffering and urban plight reveals how the processes of moral reasoning to determine the sources of evil can be interpreted very differently when there is little agreement over the divine or demonic providence of money and what the public role of religion should be.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.798165,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
219,"The outpouring of development: place, prosperity, and the Holy Spirit in Zion Ministries","This article explores a Pentecostal vision of economic development in Central America and considers how it becomes ‘really real’ for adherents, in part, through a sense of place. These Christians maintain that economic progress can only occur through the direct intervention of the Holy Spirit, whose role in development becomes apparent to them as they encounter a correspondence between three elements at three different churches: the church's level of prosperity; the intensity of the Holy Spirit; and the level of development associated with the broader locality. The article first describes this development project and explores the town of Copán Ruinas, Honduras – considered the least developed of the three places – and then provides an ethnographic account of all three churches, moving ‘up’ from Copán Ruinas through San Pedro Sula (the wealthiest city in Honduras) and ending in Guatemala City. To track the differences between these churches, the article attends to the variations in texture between them.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.798169,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
220,"Cityscapes and contact zones: Christianity, Candomblé, and African heritage tourism in Brazil","In this article the author explores the ways in which Catholic, evangelical, and Candomblé actors produce competing framings that shape encounters taking place in the city of Cachoeira in the Brazilian state of Bahia. The framing of Cachoeira as a site of heritage tourism – one where local religious practices are read as part of the African heritage and attractions for African American ‘roots tourists’ – obscures as much as it reveals. This is not to suggest that this framing is entirely inaccurate or to deny that many visitors themselves describe their trips to Bahia this way. But I contend that the ‘heritage frame’ masks key issues that complicate diasporic encounters in Cachoeira, particularly different understandings of heritage and religion and their relationship to black identity that African Americans and Afro-Brazilians bring to these encounters.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.798163,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
221,The Journal of Religion and Popular Culture: more than old wine in new bottles,"This essay delineates the history, scope and mandate of the Journal of Religion and Popular Culture (JRPC) in the larger context of Religious Studies. The JRPC produces scholarship on the myriad ways in which religion is presented, produced, studied, interpreted, rationalised, manufactured and disseminated in popular culture. This article explains the journal's distinctive genesis in a Canadian context and provides a succinct analysis of its salient themes over the last two decades, including important trajectories today. It is shown that the JRPC offers more than ‘old wine in new bottles’ both in terms of content (themes) and products (analysis). Popular culture is an indicator of the type of activities that have gained prominence in mass media for conveying religious meaning, purpose and communal experience. The ubiquity of religious themes and experiences in popular culture necessitates their continued academic study.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.801715,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43

223,Of the making of one book: contemporary introductions to Judaism,"This article discusses some of the major issues inherent in introductory courses in Judaism through an examination of seven books that were written to serve as textbooks for such a course. The seven authors surveyed are Jews who are writing about their own religious tradition as insiders, and their books are to some extent expressions of their particular orientations as Jews. It is clear to all the authors that one volume cannot by itself say everything that needs to be said about a complex religious tradition thousands of years in the making. One important commonality is their emphasis on the relationship of Judaism to Christianity. This aspect of the presentation of Judaism bespeaks the Christian (or post-Christian) nature of the English-speaking societies for which the textbooks have been created. As well, it reminds us of the imposed nature of the term ‘Judaism’ to describe the religious expression of Jews. While their approaches to the manifold historical and contemporary meanings of Judaism vary considerably, all of them are engaged in a balancing act that seeks to convey the complex historical heritage of the Jews along with other criteria more common in the study of religions, such as beliefs and rituals.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.705654,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
224,Making the invisible visible: introductory books on the Baha'i religion (the Baha'i Faith),"The present review examines five books, one by a non-Baha'i, three by a Baha'i academic, and one by a Baha'i non-academic. The non-Baha'i volume, which is very short, is by a Danish sociologist of religion, Margit Warburg. It forms a solid explanatory text informed by a lengthy experience of the Baha'is both in Denmark and abroad. This review discusses, inter alia, three volumes by a Baha'i sociologist, Peter Smith. While the three titles are very different books, taken together they form an intelligent presentation of the religion from the perspective of a thoughtful insider. Finally, the article looks at a completely different sort of book, an intelligent portrayal of Baha'ism from its spiritual and moral perspectives by Moojan Momen. This last brings readers closest to typical fare for believers and new converts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.705975,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
225,Textbooks and introductions to Western Esotericism,"This article reviews the presently available supply of textbooks and introductions to the new academic field of study known as ‘Western esotericism’. By analogy with computer software, the author refers to the early ‘religionist’ phase of research in this domain as ‘Western esotericism 1.0’. He argues that Antoine Faivre's small French textbook L’ésotérisme (1992) marked the beginning of a more satisfactory upgrade that might be referred to as ‘Western esotericism 2.0’ and remains dominant in teaching and research today. A critical review of textbooks and introductions representative of this second phase of academic professionalisation reveals a number of structural problems and weaknesses (‘bugs and design faults’) that need to be corrected in order for the field to complete its adolescence and reach academic maturity. To accommodate the needs and new perspectives of the upcoming generation of scholars in this field, it is therefore time for an upgrade to ‘Western esotericism 3.0’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.733245,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
226,The problems of rejected knowledge: thoughts on Wouter Hanegraaff's Esotericism and the Academy,"This paper engages in a critical discussion of Wouter Hanegraaff's book Western Esotericism and the Academy (2012), acknowledging its importance but also focusing on some points that appear problematic. Particular attention is given to the concept of ‘Platonic Orientalism,’ the concept of ‘form of thought,’ and the theoretical basis for a satisfactory etic definition of ‘Western esotericism.’ Hanegraaff claims that his book offers a solid argument for understanding Western esotericism ‘ultimately’ as a ‘historiographical concept,’ rather than as a ‘form of thought.’ This claim is questioned in the paper.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.767611,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
227,Some reflections on Wouter Hanegraaff's Esotericism and the Academy,The article presents some critical remarks on the recent book by Wouter Hanegraaff. There are three criticisms: his concept of ‘Platonic Orientalism’ because it doesn't correspond to the way in which we tend to read the theme of the Orient in late Antiquity today; the fact that the attention of the author is concentrated mainly on the perspective of the history of modern (German) philosophy and neglects other areas; and some problems posed by its radical historicist perspective.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.767608,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43

Some reflections on Wouter Hanegraaff's Esotericism and the Academy,"In reviewing the growth of the field of study of ‘Western esotericism,’ this article compares the attempts at delineating its intellectual and religious genealogy by von Stuckrad (Locations of Knowledge in Medieval and Early Modern Europe. Leiden: Brill, 2010) and Hanegraaff (Esotericism and the Academy: Rejected Knowledge in Western Culture. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012).

229,Discourse theory trumps discourse theory: Wouter Hanegraaff's Esotericism and the Academy,"This review article argues that Wouter Hanegraaff's Esotericism and the Academy is deeply influenced by a methodological cluster usually referred to as ‘discourse theory.’ That the author is not willing to classify his own approach as such is explained with recourse to his dispute with Kocku von Stuckrad, who, according to Hanegraaff, would embody discourse theory, whereas Hanegraaff would embody history. A comparison of Hanegraaff's Esotericism and the Academy: Rejected Knowledge in Western Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012) and von Stuckrad's Locations of Knowledge in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Esoteric Discourse and Western Identities (Leiden: Brill, 2010) reveals that this is a misleading classification and that Hanegraaff's study comes closer to what discourse theory is all about. As a consequence, Esotericism and the Academy is the very first study on ‘Western esotericism’ that offers a convincing justification of this particular label as an overarching discursive category.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.767610,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
230,Deconstructing ‘Western esotericism’: on Wouter Hanegraaff's Esotericism and the Academy,"This paper discusses a number of consequences that – although not always intended by the author – can be drawn from the radically historicist approach adopted by Wouter J. Hanegraaff in his monograph Esotericism and the Academy. These consequences are the atomization of ‘esotericism’ into a disparate range of ideas, practices, and currents with few if any shared elements; a better approximation to contemporary anthropological views of culture and cultural innovation; a focus on polemical strategies rather than substantive contents and a concomitant possibility of cross-cultural comparison; a reluctance to engage with theories of broader scope; and a vacillation between seeing ‘esotericism’ as merely a waste-basket category and attempting nonetheless to salvage a minimal substantive definition.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.767609,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43

232,"First-, second-, and third-level discourse analytic approaches in the study of religion: moving from meta-theoretical reflection to implementation in practice","During the past decade, an increasing number of scholars have started to highlight the usefulness of discourse analytical approaches in the study of religion. This article argues that the work that has been produced on the topic of discourse and religion thus far can be situated at different points along a continuum and be conceptualized in terms of first-, second-, and third-level approaches. This article aims to highlight, in particular, how the concrete application and implementation of discourse analytic theory and method in the study of religion in actual practice is dependent on these three types of approaches becoming further developed in close and more direct relation to one another.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.742742,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
233,Making space for discursive study in religious studies,"This article demonstrates the potential relevance of a discursive study of religion for Religious Studies. It outlines the main assumptions, questions, materials and methodical guidelines of a discursive study of religion and argues that the implementation of a discursive approach – its ways of constructing the approach, the research object and area of expertise – is a relevant step forward in the study of religion. However, the organisation of Religious Studies departments and the job market according to the so-called World Religions paradigm has been a major challenge in making space for discursive studies despite the intellectual criticism that has been directed towards paradigms based on religious traditions or World Religions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.742744,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
234,Esoteric currents as discursive complexes,"While the use of the term discourse is not uncommon in the study of religion, putting it into practical application in discourse-analytical approaches is. Similarly, while the esoteric is starting to be acknowledged as a legitimate field of inquiry, perspectives and approaches derived from the study of esotericism have thus far not had a big impact on the study of religion in a broader sense. In this article I will present a discourse-analytical approach to so-called esoteric currents, demonstrating how discourse analysis can be employed in the study of religion and the esoteric, as well as how it can be used to make the study of esotericism more relevant for religious studies in general.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.742741,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
235,‘There are radical Muslims and normal Muslims’: an analysis of the discourse on Islamic extremism,"In this article the author develops a multi-perspective and poly-methodical model for discourse analysis and tests it by analysing data generated through focus-group discussions on Muslim–Christian relations in Tanzania and Indonesia. By doing so, he aims to demonstrate the use and usefulness of sociocognitive discourse analysis in religious studies. First he outlines and refines an approach to discourse analysis based on Norman Fairclough. Next he describes how he uses this approach in his fieldwork, focusing on discourses on Muslim extremists in Tanzania and Indonesia. Finally he concludes that the prospects of sociocognitive discourse analysis look promising and discusses some controversial issues that yet have to be resolved.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.742745,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
236,Tracks and themes in a shifting landscape: reflections on 50 years of the study of religion,"The essay reflects on concepts that the author has found useful in navigating decades of changes in the academic study of religion. Among these themes or threads are the notions of reflexive framing and aspectualism, worlds as environments, and the continuing need to discover cross-cultural patterns. Explicating these constitutes the main section. Before that the author begins with a very brief account of how he entered the stream of the so-called History of Religions field in the 1960s, which in turn will indicate why these tracks have emerged the way they did. The discussion then takes on the gateway issue of the category religion, favoring its use as a stipulated taxon for a feature of cultural behavior, namely, interaction with gods, and thus a viable subject matter for study.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2013.744614,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-43
237,Habent sua fata libelli: thoughts on an early parody of Max Müller and other classics in comparative religious studies,"‘Books that have become classics’, Thomas Bailey Aldrich once noted, ‘always remind me of venerable colonels and majors and captains who, having reached the age limit, find themselves retired on half pay.’1  1Aldrich 1903: 20–21.  To some extent, some of the earliest classics in the comparative study of religions may be said to share this fate, being today more frequently referred or alluded to than studied in any detail. Nevertheless, the author argues that there is still a good deal of unpublished material which may yet be put to good use in elucidating the context in which these authors lived, worked, and wrote. In fact, this material may even induce us to revise current notions and question popular assumptions. This article deals firstly with a parody of F. Max Müller's solar mythology, first published anonymously in 1870, examining it in the light of its contemporary reception and of what is known about its author (the theological writer Richard Frederick Littledale) and his circle of friends. Secondly, it considers the approaches to the study of religions taken by such scholars as F. Max Müller, William Robertson Smith, James George Frazer, and Theodor Nöldeke, discussing the extent to which the spirit of the times, personal experience, professional training, and other factors contributed to shaping these approaches. Special attention is paid to the private letters of these scholars, many of which have only recently been published or are as yet unpublished, suggesting that our insight into the origins of comparative religious studies as an academic discipline may be considerably enhanced by a more extensive use of these manuscript sources. In conclusion, the article considers the complex interrelationship between primary sources, secondary literature, and the modern historiography of scholarship, examining, by way of illustration, some points of interest in recent monographs in the field.

238,On the use of the uncanny in ritual,"In ‘The Future of an Illusion’, Freud suggested that religion allows a person to ‘feel at home in the uncanny’ – that unsettling interplay of suppression and memory that arises from living subject to fears and anxieties in an unpredictable world. Here, the author examines a ritual called the ‘Wild Hunt’ that occurred during her ethnographic research among contemporary Pagans to explore how uncanny encounters within religious rituals can help participants come to terms with fears and anxieties, transforming inchoate emotions stemming from trauma or dislocation. Following Otto, the author suggests that such a sense of the uncanny can be central to the power of religious ritual. These uncanny elements within religious ritual provide an illustration of how religious experiences can help participants to feel ‘at home in the uncanny’, thereby bringing together the seemingly disparate accounts of Otto and Freud on the relationship between religion and uncanny experience.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.707802,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
239,Explorations of silence in the religious rituals of Buddhists and Quakers,"This paper is a participant-observation-based study of one Quaker and three Buddhist groups. Using a sociological framework, it explores silence as actively practiced in religious ritual. It demonstrates the usefulness of employing multiple continuums to analyze practices, including a speech–silence continuum, a body movement–body stillness continuum, and a thinking–not thinking continuum. Even when silence is seen as active, it may be construed as functioning to turn people inward and away from each other. Instead, this paper demonstrates how silence for these groups is not necessarily socially isolating. For instance, participants not only learned, practiced, and reflected on silence together, but drew connections between the practice of silence and changes in everyday social interactions, including bringing compassion into these. Some persons referred to realizing a sense of interconnectedness in the silence akin to a Meadian fusion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.704157,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
240,Tasting the divine: the aesthetics of religious emotion in Indian Christianity,"The category of rasa (emotional ‘tastes’) in Indian Christian theology and art offers a useful theoretical lens for the academic study of religious emotion. In this article, two Bharata Nāṭyam dance ministries provide a case study in the practical applicability of a rasa theology that is emerging within contemporary Indian Christianity. The Christian choreographers have significantly altered the emotions of love and peace in comparison with classical rasa theory and its traditional use in Hindu devotion. Indian Christian artists and theologians have also begun to explore and invent additional aesthetic emotions, giving unique shape to their ‘emotional community.’ Important challenges attend the dance ministries as they are currently configured, yet rasa is a capacious analytical category that can shed new light on Indian Christianity and the study of emotion in religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.638089,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
241,A new theory of religion? Introducing the review symposium on Manuel A. Vásquez: More Than Belief (2011),This essay introduces a review symposium on More than Belief: a Materialist Theory of Religion (2011) by Manuel A. Vásquez. The essay outlines the context and summarizes the structure and argument of the book. The author discusses its limitation as a full-blown theory of religion and summarizes the main points of criticism advanced by the other contributions to the review-symposium.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.705480,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
242,The benefits and risks of strategic genealogy and dichotomy,"This contribution to a symposium on Manuel A. Vásquez’ More Than Belief: A Materialist Theory of Religion (2011) looks at the role of genealogy in the book. Vásquez reviews a range of authors (from Plato to Tweed) to contextualize his view that the study of religion should place greater emphasis on embodiment, practices, and emplacement. The resulting sequence of paraphrases is highly dichotomized; some illustrate the 'dominant canon' that he critiques and some the view that he champions. This is used to illustrate two very broad 'epistemologies.' (In this light, the book champions a very general meta-theoretical stance, not a specific theory.) I suggest that this approach does not offer an argument, i.e., independent rational support, for Vásquez' view. However, it does tell a story that could be very persuasive in the study of religion, given that the use of theory in the discipline tends to be a matter of applying precedents and concepts from an accepted body of literature.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.705476,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
243,"More than belief, but not more than belief and desire","Manuel A. Vásquez’ More Than Belief: A Materialist Theory of Religion paints a rich picture of what a ‘non-reductive materialist framework for the study of religion’ would look like. Although it receives strong motivation from the inability of the predominant meta-approaches of theorizing religion to take seriously a range of materially grounded religious phenomena, it suffers somewhat from a lack of independent and autonomous argumentation. This article explores a convergence between Vásquez’ main points and the basic elements of one of the most influential positions within philosophical semantics – namely the semantic holism of Donald Davidson. Because Davidson's holism (assuming its correctness) provides constraints on all forms of theorizing, the fact that Vásquez’ position, unlike the ones he critiques, conforms to those constraints lends it a degree of rational presumption.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.705478,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
244,"Rehabilitating materiality: bodies, gods, and religion","In More Than Belief, Manuel A. Vásquez offers a theory of religion that attends to its multiple materialities by locating what religion scholars study in networks of bodies engaging in practices in particular places. With Vásquez' approach as a jumping-off point, this essay draws upon actor-network theory, as developed by John Law and Bruno Latour and applied by Albert Piette and Matthew Day, not only to attend to the materiality of human bodies but also to construe non-human entities, such as the gods and the category of ‘religion’ itself, as effective actors in the world.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.705477,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
245,Bodies and things in the forest of symbols,"Taking Manuel Vásquez's book as its point of departure, this essay explores what a truly materialist history of materiality for the study of religion might look like, in contradistinction to idealist histories of materiality. It then mounts a defense of Clifford Geertz as a pioneering scholar of material and embodied religion, against the positions taken by Vásquez and, earlier, by Talal Asad, applying a critique that has by now become overly entrenched and unquestionable.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.705479,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
246,Where angels fear to tread: neurophenomenology and the matter of belief,The article explores Manuel Vásquez’ treatment of cultural neurophenomenology within the broader context of his non-reductionist methodology. By paying particular attention to the context of Tibetan Buddhist monks in disapora – the primary subjects of neurophenomenological research – it is suggested that Vásquez’ neurophenomenology is not as culturally mediated as he claims. His treatment may undermine his larger contention that politics shape both religious experience and the scholarly methodologies used to explore them.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.706064,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
247,"On the value of genealogy, materiality, and networks: a response","In response to the challenges posed by Steven Engler, Martha Finch, Mark Gardiner, Laura Harrington, Paul Johnson, and Michael Stausberg, this essay fleshes out key terms in More than Belief (2011), including genealogy, materialism, non-reductionism, and networks, showing their value in researching and theorizing about religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.721289,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
248,The study of American religions: critical reflections on a specialization,"This essay introduces a special forum on the study of American religions. The essays in the forum consider what role, if any, the discipline of religious studies plays in shaping work within one area of specialization. This introduction attempts to place the issues raised by the contributors within the context of debates about the status of religious studies in the wake of critiques of sui generis approaches to the study of religion. In different ways, the essays argue that some kind of critical theoretical reflection is necessary for religious studies to make sense as a discipline.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.681875,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
249,The objects of American religious studies,"Disciplinary retrospectives on American religious studies have come over the last several decades to center on a single turning point, a decisive and expansive reformation of the object of scholars’ attentions. In a nutshell, somewhere between the 1970s and 1980s a vanguard among us began at last to leave off writing about white, northeastern, Protestant men and to write instead about everybody: more religions, more relations to religion, more of what counts as religion in the first place. Even as it lies at the animating heart of our disciplinary self-appraisals, however, this narrative turn from Protestantism to pluralism in American religious studies seems itself peculiarly resistant to analysis. This essay proposes that we revisit the dialectic between ‘oneness’ and ‘manyness’ in American religious history and historiography. In particular, it urges that we bring scrutiny to bear on the ways that our newer narratives of religious pluralism in America come to be spliced within a more longstanding and resilient metanarrative rooted in American Protestantism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.681876,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
250,Religious history as religious studies,"What is the relationship between religious studies and religious history? Academic historical thinking emerged in part to repudiate ecclesiastical traditions of history, making the difference between religious history and histories of religion a question of denominational rivalry more than a difference in sect. Scholars working in the academic study of religion and the academic study of history have increased self-consciousness of this contingency but have not developed an account for the consequence of history as the primary mode for our thinking. As a result, scholars of religion frequently fall silent in the wake of postcolonial critiques of religious subjects, believing their work is adequately buttressed when this history (the history of the relationship between colonial oppression and religious classification) is acknowledged. Yet this is only the beginning of our work. Religious history cannot evade the methodological challenges of religious studies precisely because to identify an object as religious is to begin an inquiry into the subject of religion itself. Using the example of the year 1893, the author seeks to demonstrate how scholars of history might justify their subjects as religious, and how scholars of religion might consider their concept of history.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.681878,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
251,‘Only one repertory’: American religious studies,"This paper assesses American Religious Studies by attending to its institutional lineages, its tone and genre, and its sometimes unconscious methodological presumptions. Exploring the implications of Zora Neale Hurston's ‘lying up a narrative,’ this piece suggests that a series of narrative, curricular, and theoretical commitments produce a particular kind of ‘religion’ as normative in the study of American religions. As the narrative of post-denominational pluralism has become normative, a discursive ambivalence has been produced wherein a liberal, identitarian conception of religion coexists awkwardly with a radical suspicion of the analytical limits of ‘religion’ as an object of study. Identifying the different nodes of this ambivalence, this essay suggests that scholars might move beyond analytical repetition or paralysis by pluralizing method, genre, and style.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.681873,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
252,"Between lived and the law: power, empire, and expansion in studies of North American religions","Taking debates about the Park51 (or ‘Ground Zero’) mosque and Islamic Community Center as a case study, this article demonstrates the need for scholars of religious traditions in North America to move beyond liberal modes of historicizing that pluralize narratives about religion but ignore how religion is defined and regulated. Liberal modes of historicizing create space for different traditions by first naturalizing differences as ostensibly fixed, inherent, and eternal – a dynamic that has proven to produce antagonistic narratives and relations as well as ‘tolerant’ ones. This is in part due to the fact that such narratives somewhat broaden the inclusivity of the U.S. public sphere but in so doing obscure the various means and power dynamics by which the boundaries of acceptable religiosity are policed. Finally, this article examines and offers analyses that provide more robust mechanisms by which to understand issues of religious diversity and liberty in the United States.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.681877,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
253,The study of American religion: looming through the glim,"The study of American religion has been expanding to include new perspectives, previously neglected characters, and new geographic insights, driven by critical reflection on the assumptions and ideologies that historically have shaped the field, such as its focus on institutions, doctrines, and texts, its nationalistic westward-expansion historical narrative, and its Protestant biases. The past two decades have seen illuminating work emerge on race and gender, popular culture, class, and the marketplace. But we need to push beyond filling in gaps in the historical record to engage methodological and theoretical concerns in the academic study of religion. Exploring the development of theories of religion in the context of global networks of exchange shaped by 19th-century seafarers is one example of how Tom Tweed's recent call in this journal for a geographic and temporal expansion of the study of religion in America might raise new questions and perspectives for the field.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.681874,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
254,My evangelical conviction,"There are three things that may serve to disrupt the casual habits of intellect operative within a majority of studies that address American religion: (1) poesis must be practiced as a challenge to flat-footed analyses invested in common-sense literacy; (2) there must be an open and honest discussion of how scholars conceive of the characters they study and how they represent those subjects in print or other media; and (3) subtle attention must be paid to issues of discourse, that is, to issues of how people make themselves up even as they are made up by ideas, concepts, and words that have nothing essentially to do with them.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.681879,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
255,Qur’ānic cosmography in its historical perspective: some notes on the formation of a religious worldview,"This article focuses on some important issues in the formation of Qur’ānic cosmography and the later development of a traditional Islamic worldview based on the Qur’ān. It examines the genealogy and characteristics of the seven-heaven and seven-earth model, as well as key cosmological terms associated with it, such as samā’ and falak. The questions of the historical transmission, assimilation, and transformation of ancient cosmological material in the Qur’ān both as a longue-durée phenomenon and as a result of immediate cross-cultural contact is addressed, with the aim of shedding light on some of the processes responsible for fashioning new religious identity. The study highlights the syncretistic nature of the Qur’ānic cosmographic model and the tensions that confront medieval and modern scholars in their attempt to harmonize, or simply account for, its various constitutive elements.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.642573,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
256,The ritualization of circumcision in medieval Judaism in relation to Islam and Christianity: an overview,"The paper analyzes the continuous medieval ritualization of Jewish circumcision with regard to interaction with the surrounding Christian and Islamic societies and their interpretations of circumcision as religious and cultural performance. While circumcision in Islamic society might have been regarded as a competing tradition that required the ritualization of Jewish circumcision as religious act, the Christian interpretation of circumcision as functionally parallel to baptism was instrumental in the development of the concept of the salvific power of circumcision. Yet the Jewish development should not be described as transfer of concepts, but as complex negotiation of Jewish and non-Jewish concepts, including the genealogical definition of Judaism and the question of national salvation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.642574,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
257,"Religion between Last Judgement, law and faith: Koranic dīn and its rendering in Latin translations of the Koran","In this article, the meaning of the Latin term religio and its equivalents in European languages is considered in a diachronical perspective, with a special focus on the history of the Koranic term dīn and its rendering in Latin translations. It is shown that the Koranic concept of religion goes back to late-antique Middle East sources, responsible for the different meanings of dīn in Koranic usage. As can be seen, there is a development from an older meaning of ‘law, judgement’ to a younger one, ‘religion’. Looking at the Latin translations of dīn from the 12th century onwards, there seems to be a similar development from lex (‘law’) to religio. This reflects, however, not only the etymology of Arabic dīn but also the influence of St Paul's theology of law picked up by Augustine and others. In the 15th century, then, Nicholas of Cusa was the first to use the term religio to denote Islam. This way, new light is shed on a (not exclusively) European Begriffsgeschichte of ‘religion ’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.642575,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
258,Resonant paradigms in the study of religions and the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism,"Was Theravāda Buddhism actually invented in late colonial times? Was Buddhism in general constructed by Orientalists’ imagination and their will to intellectually subjugate foreign cultures under the concepts of ‘Western’ thought and ‘Western’ models of social differentiation? This article argues that we need complementary perspectives to understand the multilateral dynamics that produced our present knowledge of religion(s). In the case of Theravāda Buddhism, a unidirectional analysis conceals the dynamics of questions and responses that interrelate scholars and their field of study – including modern Buddhist representatives and uses of traditional resources of knowledge – to a complex of mutually resonating agencies. As this article will show, Theravāda Buddhism, as a modern religion and as a concept of historical analysis, has emerged from these relational processes rather than having been invented by unilateral scholarly projections upon blank screens of passive cultures.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.642576,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
259,"‘Western Learning’, religious plurality, and the epistemic place of 'religion' in early-modern Korea (18th to early 20th centuries)","This paper investigates the history and pre-history of the Korean adaptation of the Western concept of 'religion' through three case studies. Based on the assumption that Koreans were not just the object of Western expansion but subjects in an 'entangled' history, it attempts to demonstrate that the intellectual challenges posed to Korean literati by their exposure to 'Western Learning' and other Others had prompted the emergence of both generic and differentiated notions of religion well before the so-called 'opening of Korea' at the end of the 19th century. Examples culled from the writings of two 18th and 19th-century Korean scholars show both the forces at work to create such notions and the limits of their potential to alter the Confucian epistemic framework within which these scholars operated. A look at an early 20th-century representative of 'religionized' Confucianism serves to highlight the persistent incompatibilities of Confucianism with differentiated religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.642577,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
260,How compatible were Durkheim and Mauss on matters relating to religion? Some introductory remarks,"Mauss's contribution to his uncle's classical study, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, has not been widely acknowledged. It is, however, difficult to assess in the light of inadequate knowledge. This essay is an introduction to the study of the relation of nephew and uncle with regard to this problem. The difference between them as people and their achievements is first briefly considered. Then attention is turned to the way they approached the sociological study of religion. Only two aspects of religion have been selected. The first considers the problems in defining religion. Durkheim holds to the notion of the sacred and Mauss to mana as being central to a definition. The second area is ritual, where there is considerable agreement, although Mauss shows little interest in effervescence. In the final analysis, the two tend to show a complementarity in their work.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.637313,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
261,Solidarity and difference: Reflections on the enigma of Durkheim and Judaism,"Durkheim's relation with Judaism is considered by specialists one of the biggest ‘mysteries’ of the great French sociologist's life and work. Above and beyond biography, the subject of Durkheim's relationship with Judaism is an important way to address the broad subject of his distinctive approach to society and solidarity. Discussing recent contributions on this topic, the paper criticizes standard interpretations according to which Durkheim's thought about society and solidarity was fully in tune with those of the Third Republic's mainstream and that – accordingly – his thought fitted modernity's wager exactly. In the author's opinion, this standard view must be revised, because it is inconsistent with Durkheim's thought toward the end of his life. Durkheim's relationship with Judaism offers a precious ground on which to test and defend this thesis.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.637314,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
262,Is Durkheim's understanding of religion compatible with believing?,"Does Durkheim's sociology of religion pose a challenge to the faithful? Durkheim said no in debate with contemporary non-believers and believers, portraying religion not as ‘mere illusion’ but as consisting in ‘moral forces’ that command, comfort and strengthen the faithful, forces generated and regenerated within them by the ‘collective effervescence’ of rituals. Thus empowered, the faithful imagine in symbolic form ‘the society of which they are members and the obscure yet intimate relations they have with it.’ Durkheim's answer is shown to have three components: a critique of naturist and animist ‘error theories’ of religion; a method of ‘deep interpretation,’ uncovering the ‘reality’ beneath the symbolism; and an explanation of why the meaning of religion thus interpreted should have been for so long unacknowledged by the faithful. It is argued that, in principle, they can, on certain assumptions, accommodate his sociology of religion. But this, in turn, makes key assumptions and claims that have been seriously questioned: notably, that ‘religion’ names a unified phenomenon and that Durkheim's definition captures it. Recent revised ‘Durkheimian’ accounts of religious thought and practice are considered, accounts that abandon these assumptions and also his ‘social realism,’ while seeking to preserve his insights. It is argued that these too need not directly challenge religious belief in the way that the cognitive science of religion does.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.637312,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
263,Japan's reception of Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse,"In Japan, Émile Durkheim's main work on the sociology of religion, Les Formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse (hereafter Les Formes élémentaires) had a major impact on not only the field of sociology, but also on the fields of anthropology and the study of religion (Shūkyōgaku). However, the detailed circumstances of this impact are not well known outside Japan, probably due to the language barrier. This article delineates the process of Japan's reception of Les Formes élémentaires, particularly before the Second World War, and considers the significance of the effect this publication had upon academic disciplines in Japan, especially the study of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.637315,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
264,Local shrines and the creation of ‘State Shinto’,"If we understand ‘State Shinto’ to refer to a concerted effort of the government to utilize shrines for popular edification (or propaganda), its origins cannot be traced back to the early years of Meiji, but must rather be sought in the 1910s and 1920s. This essay argues that the creation of ‘State Shinto’ in this sense of the word drew heavily on the activism of local shrine priests, and sees their involvement in the national management and administration of shrines in that same decade as a decisive moment. The religious nationalism advocated by such local priests transformed social understandings of both ‘religion’ and ‘shrines,’ and contributed more to the repressive atmosphere that clung to shrines in the early years of Shōwa than did top-down state enforcement.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2012.641806,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
265,The free market in religion and the metaphysical invisible hand: Benjamin Constant and the construction of religion as private,"Benjamin Constant's (1767–1830) De la Religion, considérée dans sa source, ses formes et ses développements (On Religion, Considered in its Origin, its Forms, and its Developments) (five volumes, 1824–31) is one site of the construction of the powerful modern idea of religion as private. This paper analyzes Constant's liberal and idealist conceptualization of religion, not as a program or method to be emulated today, but for the illuminating perspectives the epistemological and historical investigation of it can bring to the status of religion in liberal democratic societies today.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.640359,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
266,Rodney Stark's One True Vision: retrograde historiography and the academic study of religion,"Although Rodney Stark is best known for his work on religious economies, he has recently turned his attention to the social effects of monotheism. If we look carefully on the theoretical trajectory evident in this recent work, what we find is a social-evolutionary approach to religion that was prevalent in the 19th century, but long ago assumed by most academics to be discredited. Furthermore, as becomes increasingly evident going through this series, the particular social-evolutionary sequence that Stark constructs has been shaped by a vision of Protestant triumphalism, and a privileging of evangelical Protestantism, that also belongs to an earlier time. While it would easy to ignore Stark's work (and the last two books in this series do seem to have been ignored in academic circles), there are reasons (which include the popular appeal of his work and his treatment of Islam) for taking his work seriously.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.640358,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
267,Aporia and the postsecular," The Politics of Postsecular Religion by Ananda Abeysekara provides a novel critical intervention within the growing debate on religion and the secular. It does this by exposing a limitation of the influential form of criticism known as ‘genealogical critique’ that has become popular in disciplines such as postcolonial studies, history of religions and anthropology. By grounding critical thought on the logic of aporia, it is possible to interrupt conventional forms of critique that merely recover or inherit the name, and thus to re-imagine political futures. The paper briefly demonstrates the applicability of aporetic logic by way of reference to the violent interdictions of modes of speech that were prevalent in pre-colonial India and which eventually enabled the Western category of ‘religion’ to take root in the minds of Indian elites in the late 19th and early 20th century.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.637310,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
268,"Religion, difference and the promise of liberal political theory: on Abeysekara's The Politics of Postsecular Religion","Ananda Abeysekara's work revolves around the ‘aporia of our democratic existence.’ This review offers a close analysis of this puzzle and then connects it to the historical process whereby the internal dynamics of western Christianity gave shape to normative political theory. Normative political models have a peculiar relation to the empirical world. At any point, one can judge the factual empirical situation in a liberal democracy – no matter what that factual situation is – as deficient vis-à-vis norms like equality, freedom of expression, religious freedom and separation of church and state. The trouble is that we do not know what the ‘complete’ fulfillment of these norms would look like. Still, these norms propel political analysis: as Abeysekara notes, classical and postcolonial studies of conflict in Sri Lanka build on a set of deep-seated norms about ‘difference,’ ‘unity’ and ‘humanism,’ which have emerged from the Christian dynamic of universalization that laid the foundations of liberal political theory.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.637308,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
269,The uninheritable state and the post-public sphere,"In The Politics of Postsecular Religion (2008), Ananda Abeysekara contends that justice has to be predicated on the forgetting of systems of commensuration and calculation for an im-possibility – i.e., an ethical excess – that cannot be circumscribed by repeatable and calculable law. This ethical excess defines a space of politics that would similarly abandon the legacies of codified public memory. However, many of the elements that he identifies with uninheriting and active forgetting coincide with the ‘post-public’ sphere of Sri Lankan political culture, which undermines Habermasian assumptions of a rational and transparent public sphere. The structural forgetfulness that Abeysekara identifies with justice can be discerned in the artifacts and artifices of the Sri Lankan securitized state that is an unjust apparatus of extra-legal violence, moral indifference and orchestrated deniability.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.637309,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-42
270,Beyond the market: exploring the religious field in modern China,"This introduction discusses in general terms the applicability of the religious-economy (or market) model to the religious field in China and summarises the discussions in this special issue. This model has been adopted as a tool with which to grasp theoretically the complexities of said field; however, its application to Chinese religion(s) has taken place without an in-depth discussion of its analytical value to this subject matter. Contributions to this issue critically discuss the religious-economy model with regard to the institutionalised religions of Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism, ‘popular’ or ‘local’ religion, and the new player, 19th-century Protestant Christianity. While some contributions acknowledge a certain heuristic value of the market model, all of them point to conceptual flaws and highlight the need for revision. Taken together, they suggest a methodological pluralism in response to the pluralism of the Chinese religious field itself.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.624693,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
271,Rational choice and the Chinese discourse on the Unity of the Three Religions (sanjiao heyi 三教合一),"One of the major hypotheses of the religious-economy model is that the more unregulated the religious market is, the more diversity and pluralism will be found, the more competition there will be, and the higher the level of participation is to be expected. The article discusses this hypothesis in light of the pre-modern Chinese discourse on the Unity of the Three Religions (sanjiao heyi 三教合一). Since the rational-choice-based model is not able to provide an explanation for this specific concept, this article proposes the definition of a new case of a regulated pluralism defined by its claim to give up competition, and suggests a new kind of threefold monopoly independent from coercive measures by the state. Some explanations for this new case are provided and the usability of rational-choice theory in analysing the data gained outside of the European frame of the model is discussed. As the author will show, the religious-economy model appears only to be able to follow historical analysis and adapt its propositions accordingly; the model itself seems to be far too narrow and too undifferentiated to reliably include analyses of Chinese religions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.624692,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
272,Modalities of doing religion and ritual polytropy: evaluating the religious market model from the perspective of Chinese religious history,"This article examines the Chinese religious landscape through the lenses of ‘modalities of doing religion’ and ‘ritual polytropy’ and explores the implications such different conceptualisations might bring to the religious-market model. It argues that in Chinese religious culture one can identify five modalities of doing religion (the scriptural/discursive, the self-cultivational, the liturgical, the immediate-practical and the relational), each cutting across broader, conceptually aggregated religious traditions such as Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism. Instead of competition between membership-based churches, there is more typically competition within each modality, especially the liturgical modality. Religious pluralism in China is not manifested as the co-existence of, and competition between, confession- and membership-based denominations and churches, but rather as the co-existence of, and competition between, various ritual-service providers with different (though sometimes convergent) liturgical programmes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.624691,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
273,Gift and market in the Chinese religious economy,"Religious market theory has figured prominently in recent scholarly debates in the social scientific study of religion in China. This article argues that the existence of ‘religious markets’ should not be assumed as axiomatic but should be investigated as concrete social processes, distinguishing between market and non-market relations. Based on field research among popular religious and spiritual groups in China and drawing on the literature of economic anthropology, the author proposes an alternative model of a ‘religious gift economy’ made up of gifting exchanges between humans and between gods and humans. Five ethnographic cases from China illustrate the operation and coexistence of gift and market exchanges. In contemporary China, there is a tendency towards an increasing marketisation of religion, with a simultaneous growth of religious movements explicitly offering non-market forms of sociality. Rather than subsuming all exchanges under the blanket concept of the market, studies of religion must be attentive to the distinct logics of different models of exchange.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.616703,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
274,Conversion to Protestant Christianity in China and the ‘supply-side model’: explaining changes in the Chinese religious field,"In this article, I put the ‘supply-side model’ advocated by religious economists to an empirical test. The ‘supply-side’ model in some measure already constitutes a move ‘beyond the market’, as it seeks to expand and enlarge the economic interpretation of religion by linking it to a concept of networks and social tensions and integrating the concept of religious and cultural capital. In applying the model to the (dynamics of the) historical growth of Protestantism in 19th and early 20th-century China, I examine three distinct aspects of the conversion process: the supply-side (missionaries), the demand niches (Chinese converts), and the question of ‘strict’ churches. Arguing that the religious background of Protestant converts – their rootedness in Chinese popular religion – determined this process throughout, I seek to develop an understanding of religious competition, supply and demand that takes cultural interpretive frameworks into account.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.624694,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
275,On the market: consumption and material culture in modern Chinese Buddhism,"For many Chinese speakers in China and elsewhere, experiencing or connecting with matters of religion often includes mediation through or with material objects. Such mediation is readily accessible to larger and larger audiences and often occurs through the consumption of religious material goods, thanks also to media technologies and the Internet. In this article, the author seeks to complicate the notion that the production and consumption of novel Buddhist religious goods can be analyzed solely in terms of ‘market theory.’ While on the one hand the author shows that Buddhist technologies of salvation are historically associated with materiality, she also contends that the ‘aura’ of Buddhist-inspired modern religious goods – in the spirit of Walter Benjamin's essay ‘On Some Motifs in Baudelaire’ (1939) – is not so much effaced as it is reconfigured and transformed by technological mediations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.624698,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
276,Between scripture and performance: cohesion and dissent at the Feast of Mary's Dormition in Jerusalem,"In contrast to popular Marian rites throughout the world, the Jerusalem Dormition Feast is held on a canonical route that includes the purported sites of some of the key moments in the Virgin's life. The festival boasts an ancient liturgical order consisting of utterances and customs that are assiduously preserved by Jerusalem's Greek-Orthodox Church. Drawing on Engelke's distinction (2007 Engelke, Matthew. 2007. A Problem of Presence: Beyond Scripture in an African Church, California: University of California Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) between scriptural authority and religious performance and numerous scholarly analyses of cohesion and dissent at assorted Marian shrines (e.g., Eade and Sallnow [1991 Eade, John and Michael Sallnow. 1991. “Introduction”. In Contesting the Sacred, Edited by: Eade, John and Sallnow, Michael. 1–29. London: Routledge.  [Google Scholar]]), this article explores the reactions to the local ceremonial on the part of various participants. While the clergy strives to impose its particular reading of the Scriptures on all the attendees, the different lay groups insist on performing rituals that give expression to their own knowledge of the canon and their own understanding of the Virgin's nature. All told, their reactions range from rigid obedience to creative practices and heated dissent. The event ultimately splinters off into several factions and the host's orderly script is compromised.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.602127,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
277,"Cooking for the gods: sensuous ethnography, sensory knowledge, and the kitchen in Lucumí tradition","This article considers the ways “sensuous ethnography” can illuminate the dynamism of embodied religious perception and behavior. It discusses the author's ethnographic research in an African-American community of Lucumí/Santería practitioners on the South Side of Chicago, and explores the sensorily attentive methodological approach adopted to engage with this house of worship, Ilé Laroye. The kitchen of Ilé Laroye became the author's main fieldwork site, and this article historicizes the kitchen in Lucumí tradition as a woman-centered space that has privileged complex forms of labor defined as generative of virtue and ritual competence. It is argued that post-sacrificial food preparation in particular has served to prepare the uninitiated for the rigors of Lucumí priesthood, and proven necessary for the internalization of dispositions and sensibilities that lead to initiation. The author contends that kitchen work has played a key role in transmitting somatic knowledge indispensable for the practice of this Afro-Cuban tradition.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.619585,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
278,Introductory essay: Evolutionary science and the study of religion,"In this article, we introduce the general rationale behind the evolutionary cognitive science of religion, answer some sensible humanistic objections to it and defend the promise of a ‘consilient’ approach to advance the academic study of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.604513,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
279,The role of evolutionary psychology within an interdisciplinary science of religion,"The recent explosion of research on religion by biologists, anthropologists, and psychologists offers the prospect of a truly interdisciplinary science organized by an evolutionary paradigm. However, such unification will be elusive in the absence of proper vertical integration of biological, psychological, and anthropological levels of analysis. This article reviews arguments for an evolutionary approach to psychology that is consistent with, and founded upon, evolutionary biology; it then argues that in the same manner, an evolutionary approach to anthropology must be consistent with, and founded upon, evolutionary psychology. The author suggest that ongoing debates in the evolutionary study of religion, such as whether religion is an adaptation or a byproduct, often conflate biological, psychological, and cultural levels of analysis, and often fail to appreciate the indispensible role of the psychological level of analysis between biological and cultural levels. In the final section, the author attempts to articulate this role in an effort to promote true vertical integration of psychological and anthropological evolutionary approaches to religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.604511,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
280,The behavioral ecology of religion: the benefits and costs of one evolutionary approach,"Applying evolutionary analyses to the study of religion is fraught with complications and potential misunderstandings. Most notably, the evolutionary sciences do not offer one clear procedure to study religion or any human activity. Here we describe the behavioral ecological approach to religion. We explain the theoretical motivations behind behavioral ecological research and discuss the methodologies employed to conduct this research. We argue that despite its limitations, behavioral ecology can offer important benefits to religious scholarship by providing a coherent and powerful framework for generating, testing and discarding hypotheses about specific aspects of religious behaviors and cultures.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.604514,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
281,Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation,"How does religion motivate cooperation? How do the factors (genetic and cultural) that cause these motivations variously evolve, and why are they conserved? Cooperative-signalling theories of religion answer these questions by generalising from well-supported principles and research in the life sciences. Cooperative-signalling theories are interesting because they explain existing puzzles in the data about religions, and lead to testable hypotheses. This article discusses how signalling theory has been applied to explain the evolution and conservation of religiously motivated cooperation at small and large social scales, and reviews evidence relevant to evaluating these applications.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
282,"THE CULTURAL TRANSMISSION OF FAITH Why innate intuitions are necessary, but insufficient, to explain religious belief","The cognitive science of religion integrates insights from diverse scientific disciplines to explain how people acquire, represent and transmit religious concepts. This perspective has led to a fruitful research program on the naturalistic origins of religion. However, it has thus far not directly addressed a key component of religion: faith or committed belief. The present review proposes a framework that integrates standard approaches from the cognitive science of religion with established models of cultural evolution and cultural learning. According to this synthetic approach, innate cognitive content biases explain how people mentally represent gods, and cultural evolutionary models explain why people come to believe and commit to the particular supernatural beliefs that they do. This synthesis offers a more complete picture of the origins and cultural persistence of religious belief.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.604510,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
283,Marxism and the spatial analysis of early Christianity: the contribution of G.E.M. de Ste. Croix,"This is an in-depth engagement with the neglected Marxist classicist, G.E.M. de Ste. Croix. Although Ste. Croix's focus was Ancient Greece and, to some extent, Ancient Rome, he wrote extensively on the New Testament and early Christianity. In this respect, the author focuses on four key features of Ste. Croix's work: his spatial analysis – the distinction between chora and polis – of the Gospel narratives in relation to Jesus, and the treatments of property, slavery and women, especially in the way the early church quickly gave up the radical nature of its founder's positions. Although the article critiques elements of Ste. Croix's analysis, particularly in terms of historical narratives that assume a ‘fall’ narrative and his desire for linear and singular interpretations, it is more interested in the gems of his analysis, not least of which is the spatial analysis and the way he unwittingly highlights the issue of contradiction.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.577825,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
284,Seeking a ‘pure relationship'? Israeli Religious-Zionist singles looking for love and marriage,"Research conducted over the past 20 years has found that there have been changes in attitudes towards romantic relationships in late modernity. Partners expect more of relationships, and they are abandoned more easily than they were in the past. Religious fundamentalists reject both late-modern and modern attitudes towards romantic love, but the question of how moderate religious individuals and groups are affected by these changes remains unexamined. The article addresses this issue by focusing on the case of Israeli Religious-Zionist singles. Using Anthony Giddens' model of a gradual progression from a romantic love to a confluent love ideal type, the article claims that while Religious-Zionist dating norms encourage the romantic love ideal type of relationship, singles have gravitated toward a confluent love mindset; the rabbis, in an attempt to remedy the situation, adopt the Ultra-Orthodox ideology that views romantic love as superfluous. The results indicate that moderate religious individuals are indeed affected by late-modern attitudes towards intimate relations, and this is a source of tension since they continue to espouse religious 'family values' as well.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.583997,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
285,In Mysterious Ways: On petitionary prayer and subtle forms of supernatural causation,"The psychology of prayer and supernatural causation has received surprisingly little attention from empirical researchers. This paper discusses implicit belief patterns about the causal mechanisms by which God effects changes in the world. The authors offer a psychological account of belief in supernatural causation based on the existing empirical literature on petitionary prayer, incorporating mechanisms of psychological self-correction and rationalisation, confirmation bias and folk physics. They propose that religious believers ‘prefer’ modes of divine action that are subtle and indistinguishable from the natural course of events: given that the causal structure of our world is partly inscrutable, beliefs in subtle and unascertainable modes of supernatural causation will be compelling and cognitively appealing because they are more susceptible to occasional confirmation and less vulnerable to repeated disconfirmation. In other words, believers who request supernatural interventions that are subtle and indistinguishable from the natural course of events will have a better chance of finding themselves in a situation in which they can attribute the events in question to God answering their prayers. The authors argue that such individual psychological factors play a role in the cultural transmission of prayer practices as well, leading to culturally widespread beliefs in subtle forms of supernatural causation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.600464,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
286,Religion and Film Studies through the Journal of Religion and Film,"The Journal of Religion & Film (JR&F) provides scholars around the world with a forum for discussing the relationship between religion and film. It provides a venue where scholars and others interested in religion and film can join in a discussion about how God is portrayed in film, the retelling of religious studies, the retelling of religious stories, religious themes, film as religion, promoting religion, religion and film in dialogue, and interpreting film through religion. Creating the Journal as an open-access online publication provides readers around the world with access to the sharing of ideas. Film reviews, in addition to scholarly articles, provide readers with information about new films and rare films that are not easily available. The Journal enjoys a readership of not only scholars, but also people in the film industry and students – as well as the media and public interested in religion and film. Its authors come from nearly every continent and provide readers not only with a look at film and religion's history and status but also a look into the future  1Ron Burke died of cancer in April 2002.

Crisis and creativity: opportunities and threats in the global study of religion\s,"This article introduces the themes and articles of a special symposium on new directions in the organizational structures and pedagogical emphases of religious studies programs around the world. The thematic focus of this symposium is the range of ways that specific religious studies departments and programs have recently experienced dramatic changes, whether in response to financial, administrative, and other external pressures (‘crisis’) or as a proactive step, aiming at greater student success or manifesting an innovative vision of the nature and function of the discipline (‘creativity’). The authors begin by addressing the nature and status of the study of religion\s as an academic discipline.

288,Wither or whither: the study of religion at the University of Alberta,"In this paper the authors trace very briefly the most consequential points of the history of Religious Studies at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This history demonstrates that the structural location and the disciplinary horizon of Religious Studies are central factors in whether Religious Studies is a marginal, threatened endeavor or whether it has a central, thriving place within the family of social sciences in a larger, research-oriented university. The main advantages and disadvantages of a cross-departmental and multi-disciplinary Program in the Study of Religion are presented in the last part of the paper.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.579788,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41

290,Training the next generation of teachers of Religious Studies: a Canadian case study,"This paper offers a framework for redesigning Religious Studies doctoral programs so as to include a stream that prepares students to be teachers. The example used is the Canadian Laurier–Waterloo Ph.D. program. Carefully configured teacher training need not extend the length of a program, and it will prepare students to take up teaching and other positions both inside and outside universities and colleges. Introducing teacher training within a doctoral program will require some additional university resources, but will especially require rethinking the priorities of graduate education in the early 21st century.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.579789,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
291,A critical appraisal of recent trends in the teaching of Religious Studies in Nigerian universities,"The study and teaching of religious traditions pre-dates political independence in Nigeria. Certain features have usually marked this enterprise since it commenced. One is the assumption that students of religions who graduate from the universities can only work as preachers or teachers of religion. Second, the number of candidates applying for the study of religions in Nigerian universities has remained small. Third is the belief that religion has little value in the employment market, because its relevance is limited to the spiritual sensitivities of adherents of the religion concerned. These features have remained unabated and compelled the review of courses in the study of religions in some Nigerian universities. This review addresses the above-mentioned assumptions and argues that religion is a crucial educational component with far-reaching implications for the human phenomenon. This paper seeks to evaluate the current situation concerning the study and teaching of religions in Nigerian universities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.579790,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
292,The many faces of Religious Studies and the multiplicity of religious traditions in Japan,"The Japanese Association of Religious Studies (JARS) had 2112 members in 2006, a fairly large number. On the other hand, among 756 universities in Japan, there are only ten universities with departments or courses in Religious Studies or the academic study of religion. In spite of this unfavorable situation, JARS has been quite active and Religious Studies is widely recognized within Japanese academia. Because religious traditions in Japan are multiple and interconnected to each other in complicated ways, scholars have been working on them from various perspectives and by various methods. JARS is recognized by a wide range of scholars as an appropriate institution for discussing various topics related to multiple traditions. This has become possible because Religious Studies in Japan has been dealing widely with various religious traditions; it is one major academic institution for comparison and dialog among various traditions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.579783,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
293,Into the cloud of the unknown: the future of Religious Studies in UK universities,"The higher-education system in the UK, and especially England, is currently undergoing an unprecedented amount of change through massive cuts, a completely new system of student funding, the inclusion of impact in the assessment of research, and the disappearance of small departments into larger faculties. This paper considers the background to this revolution and looks at the policies that are driving it. After initially looking at this in general terms, the paper will consider what this means for teaching and research in the Humanities, and more specifically for the study of religion (in its broadest sense). The paper also seeks to look at any opportunities that these changes may bring, and considers some creative solutions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.586154,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
294,The Bologna process and the study of religion\s in (Western) Europe,The Bologna Declaration of 19 June 1999 signed by ministers of education from 29 European countries resulted in the so-called Bologna process: a starting point and platform for various university reforms in the signatory countries. The present paper explores the implications of the Bologna process for the situation of the study of religion\s in selected countries that are subject to this process.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.586259,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
295,Religionswissenschaft and the challenge of multi-religious student groups,"Multi-religious student groups pose challenges to Religious Studies programmes. This essay proposes a pedagogical method for tackling feelings of exclusion among students who do not share the secular post-Judeo-Christian worldview that is often taken for granted in European curricula. It argues that the diverse backgrounds of the students can be made an asset rather than a problem if principles of self-contextualisation, non-confessionalism, perspectivism and equal treatment of different traditions are articulated and brought to the fore as vital parts of studying Religionswissenschaft at the undergraduate level.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.579784,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
296,What (kind of) good is Religious Studies?,"In highlighting common themes among the articles from the panel, this essay focuses especially on two related movements in higher education: an apparently global emphasis on education as preparation for employment and the application of administrative models derived from business to universities and colleges. In critically interrogating both movements, it suggests that there need not always be a high degree of correlation between what a person studies at university and his or her later occupation, and further, that a managerial administrative vision tends to neglect the ‘positive externalities’ that derive from subjects that do not lead directly to employment for a large number of students. Thus, the results of both movements are disadvantageous not only for the study of religions but also for society at large.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.579786,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
297,"Dreaming in religion and pilgrimage: cognitive, evolutionary and cultural perspectives","Dreams are a universal human experience and they form cultural themes in folk traditions and religious rituals, such as pilgrimages and dream incubation. Dreams and dream beliefs are important since they contain representations of interacting supernatural agents that have full access to information of strategic importance to humans. The relevance of dreams often relates to the dreamers' concerns about the future and about health, and in this sense they show similarity with divination and oracles. This article suggests that religious dreaming is underpinned by an evolved system of threat simulation that is activated in dreaming processes; this is associated with a proclivity to evoke agent concepts and to use counterintuitive representations in cultural communication. It is argued that the use of a ‘hypersensitive agency detection device’ draws upon emotionally laden threat simulation in dreaming that makes reference to counterintuitive supernatural agents that are particularly relevant. This suggests that recalling religious dreams and the cultural transmission of dream reports, narratives and interpretations rely on representations of agents in general and the salience of counterintuitive agents in particular. Furthermore, the explanatory adequacy of ‘threat simulation theory’ is related to non-apprehensive religious dreams and ‘social simulation theory’. These discussions lead on to ethnographic descriptions of the connections between ‘supernaturalism’, pilgrimage, dream beliefs and dream incubation rituals in Nepalese Himalaya and Indian Bengal.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.553141,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
298,Religious narrative and the literary fantastic: ambiguity and uncertainty in Ex. 1–18,"This paper presents a perspective for the analysis of the literary form of myth drawn from literary-critical theories of the fantastic and fantasy. The aim is to demonstrate the value of such analyses for understanding what a religious narrative is and what it does – as an addition to existing approaches (phenomenological, historical, structuralist, formalist, and so on.) To achieve this aim, the paper presents a fantasy-theoretical case study of the Exodus narrative from the Hebrew Bible (Ex. 1–18). The analysis shows that this narrative of the fantastic events at Israel's exodus from Egypt confounds distinctions (natural/supernatural, benign/malign, self/other, hope/horror), generates varied reactions in the personae, foregrounds the uncertainty and ambiguity of the events, and points to its own artifice. The literary strategies are shown to have effects that are apt to unsettle, disturb and fascinate; effects that are both semantic and affective, mobilising the recipients in the interpretation of the status, veracity and meaning of the fantastic events. Proposals are then made about the literary fantastic as a fruitful analytical perspective specifically for narratives about metamorphoses and miracles, and about incorporating destabilisation, uncertainty and ambiguity more strongly into theories of what a religious narrative is and does in the study of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.570798,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
299,A country without minarets: analysis of the background and meaning of the Swiss vote of 29 November 2009,The Swiss popular vote of 29 November 2009 banning the building of minarets reflects wider trends across Europe regarding Islam. It cannot be reduced merely to anti-immigration feelings. Minarets have been used as a symbol of what Islam is alleged to represent. Islam is being constructed as an ideological threat in a way that is to a large extent disconnected from the local Muslim population and largely derives from wider developments and perceptions. The article provides an analysis of the background of the vote and of the various reasons that contributed to the outcome.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.553140,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
300,Angels not souls: popular religion in the online mourning for British celebrity Jade Goody,"The presence of angels in contemporary Western popular cultures has been noted, but not their presence in contemporary mourning. This study analyses online tributes for Jade Goody, a young British celebrity who died of cervical cancer in 2009; though a few of these tributes mention souls, many more refer to angels. Some refer to traditional Christian angels transporting Jade to heaven and caring for her there, while others draw on an unorthodox but popular tradition of the deceased herself becoming an angel, in which role Jade continues to care for her two young children. Ambiguity and fluidity of meaning are evident in many of the angel tributes. They portray neither a theocentric nor an anthropocentric heaven, but rather one in which the dead can continue to care for the living; for this the dead need agency, which angels have but souls do not. Through the symbol ‘angel’, Jade's lower-class and theologically uneducated mourners succeed in linking three levels – pre-mortem identity, a broadly Christian notion of heaven, and the ongoing agency of the dead in the lives of the living – something that often eludes both religious and bereavement professionals.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.553138,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
301,Religious studies in Francophone Canada,"The article gives a brief descriptive overview of Religious Studies departments (and programs) in Francophone Canada in general, and in Quebec in particular. The scope of inquiry is limited to officially recognized Francophone and bilingual departments. Following Alles (2008), the article privileges a specific understanding of Religious Studies departments: those who constrained themselves to a ‘scientific’ (secular), non-theological, approach to the study of religion. Therefore, Theology programs are excluded from the present survey; these programs represent, however, a large proportion of the academic study of religion in the province of Quebec.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.553127,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
302,Dreaming and god concepts,"McNamara's book draws on dream research to explain the generation of god concepts as ‘minimally counter-intuitive’ agents. This review examines the actual evidence McNamara presents to support that claim, and finds it lacking in several ways. Although his book does not provide a convincing argument that dreams are a source of god concepts, McNamara's insightful idea opens up new possibilities for bridging dream research and the cognitive science of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.553124,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
303,"Religious experiences, transformative paths and religious goals","Though McNamara indicates that his focus is mainly on theistic forms of religious experience common in the West, it is important to consider how his broadly stated thesis might be affected by data from traditions other than those that are the focus of his book. Although he is right to call our attention to the processes through which religious traditions promote and religious practitioners cultivate experiential states, his approach is limited by his non-attributional conceptualization of religious experience as the culmination of one path toward one goal. A more nuanced approach would require attending more closely to: (1) the diversity of ‘experiences’ that religious traditions set apart as being of particular importance; (2) the diversity of practices that are prescribed as being efficacious towards the attainment of those experiences; and (3) the dynamic relationship between individual practitioners and authorities of a religious tradition, wherein questions of authenticity arise and experiences are deemed ‘religious’ or not.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.553135,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
304,McNamara's cognitive model of self-transformation,"In choosing between theories of the self, McNamara selects from those that are limited to humans, rather than from multi-level conceptions that highlight that which we share with other animals. The ability of other animals to take goal-directed action without reflecting self-consciously on their choices suggests that the sense of division that interests McNamara emerges developmentally in tandem with the more complex human sense of Self. McNamara's model of self-transformation through decentering is based on cognitive models of pretend play, which is precisely the context in which some theorists believe these more complex capacities emerge. Although the process of decentering may have played a role in the cultural evolution of the executive Self, research on play suggests that it was the human capacity for pretend play that enabled the development of the more complex human self and not religious practices or institutions per se.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.553136,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
305,The neural correlates of religious experience,"McNamara's claim that there is overlap between the brain sites implicated in religious experience and those implicated in the sense of self and self-consciousness rests on two postulates: (1) that the ‘executive Self’ can be identified as a neural entity in specific regions of the brain; and (2) that the neural correlates of religious experience can be identified as a consistent set of activations in these regions. Although McNamara is clearly well informed in terms of functional neuroanatomy, he fails to make a convincing argument for his first postulate regarding the existence of the self as a controlling entity at the neurological level. This is unfortunate because his claim that religious experience decenters the self from its control over body and cognition in order to contemplate and optimize the self rests on this assumption. Furthermore, with respect to his second postulate, since the data currently available do not afford a description of religious experience as a uniform category, it is difficult to see how this evidence can support McNamara's general understanding of the nature and function of religious experience. McNamara may be right that some religious practices are intimately related to the transformative processes of the self, but only future studies can tell whether this idea can be supported by the neurosciences.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0048721X.2011.553132,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-41
306,Towards the concerned study of religion: Exploring the double power–play disparity,"Increasing numbers of students of religion, from various disciplines, address issues of public interest, going beyond documentation and analysis, taking the quality of human life in religion and society as a criterion for their recommendations. Accordingly, systematic reflection on the concerned study of religion is gaining relevance. The approach chosen in this article is to focus on one particular aspect, in this case the double ‐ cognitive and moral ‐ disparity in religious contexts between forms of power and play.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.07.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
307,Mind and mood in the study of religion,"This paper is a reflection on the attempt of authors like E. Valentine Daniel, S.Balagangadhara, Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald and Tomoko Masuzawa to argue that the word “religion” is most appropriately used to describe Christianity but that it tends to distort description and analysis of nonwestern traditions. My concern is to correct their tendency to divide the world between east and west by using Daniel's (and C.S. Peirce’s) notions of Mind and Mood to analyze a variety of religious traditions, east and west, that fulfill different social and cultural functions, and thus relate to definitions of words like “religion” and “dharma” and “shukyo” in a variety of ways.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
308,Expanding the study of U.S. religion: Reflections on the state of a subfield,"The study of U.S. religion, which dates from the 19th century, expanded its sources, methods, and scope during the last quarter of the 20th century, as specialists offered more inclusive historical narratives. That methodological expansion never went far enough, however, and the impulse toward narrative inclusiveness has been restrained in recent years. The subfield, I argue, now faces a number of challenges that also confront other specializations in the study of religiondcontraction, overspecialization, fragmentation, and parochialism. After a focused overview of the subfield's history, I discuss those challenges. Proposing a tentative response, I suggest that specialists celebrate methodological diversity and theoretical sophistication, encourage comparative and translocative studies, and increase collaboration across disciplinary boundaries and national borders. Finally, I suggest that we expand the subfield's temporal span and geographical scope and reframe the study of U.S. religion in terms of the Atlantic World, the Pacific World, and the Western Hemisphere",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.03.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
309,"The history of religions and francophone research in Europe: Main disciplinary trends in Switzerland, France, Belgium and Luxemburg","This article provides an overview (as of September, 2008) of the state of the field of l’histoire des religions in the four french-speaking countries of Europe. It discusses the pioneers, along with their followers and influence, the position of principle institutions regarding teaching in the field, and the general orientations of each university, along with distinct emphases that reflect recent socio-political and cultural developments. This detailed panorama brings to light the relative weakness of french-speaking research in the field of l’histoire générale des religions. It calls attention to tensions between the former high status of this academic area, more than half of a century ago, and the disrepute into which its comparativist project has fallen over the last decades. It asks how French secularism ‐ and the growing secularization of western societies more generally ‐ may have influenced perceptions of the discipline, its orientations, and its position in today's academic market academic market.

310,Implicit Religion,"Implicit Religion: the Journal of the Centre for the Study of Implicit Religion and Contemporary Spirituality began publication in 1998, but the formal study of Implicit Religion began just thirty years before, in 1968. Its study concentrates upon those aspects of everyday life, the understanding of which may be enhanced if we ask whether they might have, within them, some sort of inherent religiosity of their own. While many other terms, and many other journals, have some degree of overlap with this area of interest, now, it is thought that this Journal is unique in its consistent study of the non-reductionist theory and empirical manifestations of (what might be termed) “secular faith.”",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.07.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
311,"From 1799 to 2009: Religious Experience Reconsidered—background, argument, responses","This introductory essay to a review symposium on Religious Experience Reconsidered by Ann Taves (2009) briefly reviews some main stages of the discussion of religious experience in the study of religion\s with special attention to the Romantic tradition and its apologetic legacy and to more recent attempts to revise, rehabilitate, or challenge this key category.

312,Ann Taves's Religious Experience Reconsidered is a sign of a global apocalypse that will kill us all,"According to Ann Taves, many humanist scholars of religion are afraid of science. In particular, they object to scientific reductionism because reductive explanations violate taboos that prohibit reducing religion to something else. This essay will analyze how Taves and other proponents of cognitive approaches to religious studies fashion a kind of secular praxis in which breaking taboos is a crucial attribute of scholarly integrity and intellectual heroism. I will argue that this equation between reason and profanation reproduces the discursive logic that legitimates the global expansion of a constellation of overlapping secular scientific, economic, political, and religious institutions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
313,"Magic feathers, Wittgensteinian boxes and the politics of deeming","Religious Experience Reconsidered offers an “attribution theory of religion” which builds out from Emile Durkheim's intuition that the sacred is just some aspect of the world that has been set apart. Despite this theoretical pedigree, however, the book violates the central Durkheimian insight when it goes on to ask whether some things are more likely to be set apart than others. I argue that this impulse is motivated by an unfortunate metaphysical desire to determine if some things really are special. Throwing my hat in with Durkheim, I maintain that the academic study of religion should rest content with analyzing the contested politics of “deeming” something special.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
314,“Experiences deemed religious”: Radical critique or temporary fix? Strategic ambiguity in Ann Taves’ Religious Experience Reconsidered,"Ann Taves has written an interesting, lucid and informative book. In particular, the author's suggested reformulation of religious studies as the study of “things deemed special” indicates a critical alternative to the dominant discourse. But such a reformulation implies that the ‘secular’ side of the mutually parasitic religion‐secular binary also requires deconstruction. This in turn must surely lead to a critique of the representation of social psychology and related disciplines as ‘natural science’, a representation which itself is already dependent on the wider, globalizing, ideological religion/secular binary, and its supernatural/natural correlate. The author's ambiguous alternation between things deemed special and things deemed religious invites the discursive contours of ‘religion’ to re‐enter through the back door, leaving the status quo substantially intact",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.005,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
315,From “…of religion” to “Psychology of…”: Commentary on Ann Taves’ Religious Experience Reconsidered,"I arasuggest that Taves' prescription for Religious Studies and related fields comprises a shift in perspective for approaching the psychology of religion, from an of‐religion perspective to a psychology‐of perspective, and that this reframing has a number of important and promising implications for future progress. I then use this perspective‐shift characterization to extend and comment upon Taves' discussion of several key issues, including the distinction between ascriptive and sui‐generis models of religion, the need for a building‐block approach to religion and religious experience, and the problem of defining religion",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.006,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
316,"Specialness and the sacred: Ann Taves, Religious Experience Reconsidered","Ann Taves proposes an encompassing framework of ‘specialness’ in which both simple and complex ascriptions of things deemed significant — whether religious, spiritual, magical or ideological — may be contained. Her preference for ‘specialness’ over other terms is clearly argued, but does not adequately take into consideration recent, comparable research on the ‘sacred’, in particular the work of Anttonen. Whilst acknowledging the flawed nature of ‘sacred’ as a scholarly resource, I note that it may not be easily set aside. Unlike ‘special’, ‘sacred’ has deep and wide‐ranging cultural resonances that not only attract and repel scholars in equal measure, but remain at the heart of popular and theological usage for signalling those things, places, values and issues that are non‐negotiable, forbidden, or of deep and abiding significance",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
317,Attribution and building blocks: Comment on Ann Taves's Religious Experience Reconsidered,"Taves nicely elaborates an attribution approach to the study of religious experience, clarifying the issues it raises and providing some guides for further research. This comment addresses two of those issues, (1) the relation of top‐down and bottom‐up accounts of religious experiences and (2) what Taves describes as the building block approach to their study",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.008,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
318,Does Taves reconsider experience enough? A critical commentary on religious experience reconsidered,"Three problems beset Ann Taves' thought-provoking book. The first is her failure to recognize that her focus on “experiences deemed religious” makes just as many metaphysical claims as does the focus on “religious experiences” that she seeks to replace. Second, her building-block definition of religion drops her into the middle of controversies over the nature of religion, rather than rescuing her from them. Third, her approach embodies a peculiarly North American cultural ambiguity about religion: on the one hand, it contains an abstract democratic affirmation of the importance of studying people's beliefs and practices on their own terms; on the other hand, it pairs to this a concrete sense of horror at what those beliefs and practices actually are.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.009,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
319,Why philosophy and history matter: A conversation with Ann Taves,"The article picks up some ideas that Ann Taves presents in her book Religious Experience Reconsidered, and looks at possible conversations that are not fleshed out in detail in Taves' book. In particular, it is argued that the disciplinary confrontation with philosophy and with historiography is of crucial importance if the disciplines of cognitive science and psychology of religion want to become in the future what they pretend to be nowda serious alternative and complement to the study of religion as we know it from other contexts, such as cultural studies and historiography",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.010,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
320,Experience as site of contested meaning and value: The attributional dog and its special tail,"Religious Experience Reconsidered was premised on the idea that experience is a site of contested meaning and value for subjects (and scholars). Although the concept of specialness has drawn considerable attention, my goal in writing the book was to update efforts to use attribution theory to bridge between religious studies and the psychology of religion. I intended the focus on micro-social processes to complement analysis at the macro-social level. The need for a broader, more generic second order term, such as specialness, emerged in the context of working out an attributional approach and can and should be extended more broadly. While anything can be set apart as special and an analysis of the politics of deeming is essential, we can still ask if there is empirical evidence to suggest that humans are more likely to set some things apart than others within or across cultures. When we take experience as a site for study, we do not have to limit ourselves to describing the range of views held by our subjects, but can also legitimately seek to explain experience in terms that make sense to us as researchers. The breaking of taboos against explaining experience in naturalistic terms will only have apocalyptic consequences if we assume a special/ordinary binary; viewed on a continuum, we can still find special meaning and value in experiences that are not protected by taboos.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.09.012,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
321,"Religion is natural, atheism is not: On why everybody is both right and wrong","After discussing evidence of irreligion and the rise of the so called “New Atheism”, the authors refute the claim that this poses a problem for the cognitive science of religion and its hypothesis that religion is natural. The “naturalness hypothesis” is not deterministic but probabilistic and thus leaves room for atheism. This, the authors maintain, is true of both the by‐product and adaptationist stances within the cognitive science of religion. In this context the authors also discuss the memetic or “unnaturalness” hypothesis, i.e. that religion is a “virus of the mind”. The authors criticize accounts of atheism offered by cognitive scientists of religion as being based on unfounded assumptions about the psychology of atheists, and object to the notion that the natural aspects of religion by corollary make atheism unnatural. By considering human cognition in a semiotic framework and emphasizing its natural ability to take part in semiotic systems of signs, atheism emerges as a natural, cognitive strategy. The authors argue that to reach a fuller account of religion, the cognitive (naturalness) and memetic (unnaturalness) hypotheses of religion must be merged. Finally, a preliminary analysis of the “New Atheism” is offered in terms of semiotic and cognitive dynamics",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.11.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
322,Atheism is only skin deep: Geertz and Markusson rely mistakenly on sociodemographic data as meaningful indicators of underlying cognition,"Cognitive scientists of religion and evolutionary theorists alike have been increasingly arguing in recent years that religion is “natural” in the sense of being motivated by core, evolved psychological intuitions. Atheism, and irreligion more generally, appear to pose problems for the naturalness hypothesis, especially considering the significant proportion of people in contemporary societies who reject supernatural beliefs. Although Geertz and Markusson clarify why the naturalness hypothesis does not imply religious determinism, they fail to weigh adequately the more conservative prediction, that of religious probabilism. Furthermore, unlike cognitive scientific accounts favoring the naturalness hypothesis, the authors base their arguments for the cultural scaffolding of atheistic cognition on sociodemographic data aloneda—source that is unlikely to be a meaningful reflection of “natural” underlying cognitive processes",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.11.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
323,The relative unnaturalness of atheism: On why Geertz and Markússon are both right and wrong,"Commonly scholars in the cognitive science of religion (CSR) have advanced the naturalness of religion thesis. That is, ordinary cognitive resources operating in ordinary human environments typically lead to some kind of belief in supernatural agency and perhaps other religious ideas. Special cultural scaffolding is unnecessary. Supernaturalism falls near a natural anchor point. In contrast, widespread conscious rejection of the supernatural as in atheism appears to require either special cultural conditions that upset ordinary function, cognitive effort, or a good degree of cultural scaffolding to move people away from their maturationally natural anchor‐points. Geertz and Markússon (2009) identify ways to strengthen cognitive approaches to the study of religion and culture, including atheism, but fail to demonstrate that atheism is as natural in a comparable respect as theism",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.11.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
324,Positionality and role‐identity in a new religious context: Participant observation at Céu do Mapiá,"This article reflects upon the participant observational method in light of fieldwork undertaken in the Amazonian community of Mapiá. Mapiá is the spiritual headquarters of the largest branch of the Brazilian new religious movement of Santo Daime. Noting how my ritual participation gave rise to the ascription of a qualified insider identity, the following explores how variations in the identity ascribed to me (viz. ‘provisional insider’, ‘potential real‐insider’ and ‘counterfeit insider’) refract variegated articulations of the Santo Daime worldview. Employing Patricia Hill Collins' notion of the ‘outsider‐within’, I conclude by arguing that it is naive to see participant observation as a medium through which outsider status is straightforwardly transmuted to insider belonging. Rather, participant observation is best regarded as a methodological strategy for negotiating a complex spectrum of identities comprising any number of fluid and variegated subjectivities",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.09.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
325,Remembering our violent conversion: Conflict in the Icelandic conversion narrative,"This article analyzes violent conflict in the medieval narratives of Iceland's conversion to Christianity, as told by the Icelanders themselves. The article considers physical and verbal aggression as interrelated forms of conflict connected in an economy of violent exchange. In the narratives, they are represented as attacks against material and symbolic resources. The competing pagans and Christians struggle to come out ahead as often as they can and thereby win the most converts. Verbal violence takes center stage in this analysis, more specifically three kinds of verbal violence: a particular sub‐genre of insults; coercive speech; and speech as a means of supernatural power. The first of these, the insults use deeply embedded medieval Icelandic constructions of gender to create a highly corrosive discourse that combines cowardice, homosexuality and laziness, among other things, as the traits of the least desirable sort of man. Finally, in contrast the commonplace occurrence of violent conflict in these texts, an internal critique of violence appears in the later versions of the conversion story. This critique reconsiders what forms of violence are legitimate, most significantly disapproving of the previously accepted masculine activity of revenge.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.10.011,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
326,Constructing the boundaries of Anglican orthodoxy: An analysis of the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON),"This article examines the evolution of the transnational orthodox Anglican movement through the lens of the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON)—the movement's most significant public expression to date. GAFCON represented the first large‐scale event at which a sizable number of Anglicans (ordained and lay) from both the global North and global South gathered to galvanise an ‘orthodox’ response to the current ‘crisis’ in the Anglican Communion (a crisis precipitated by debates over the status of homosexuality). The analysis is based upon fieldwork conducted at GAFCON, a review of a range of documentary sources, and retrospective interviews with several attendees. The article argues that GAFCON constituted a key moment for the attempted framing of movement objectives for participants, other Anglicans, and outside observers, fixing a standard of orthodoxy in the final Jerusalem Declaration. While attempting to project an image of orthodox unity to outsiders, GAFCON leaders also made the negotiation of certain aspects of cultural difference central to the event's purpose. Detailed examinations are provided of two topics (homosexuality and female ordination) that exemplify the ongoing negotiation of the boundaries of orthodoxy within the movement. The article concludes with reflections on the significance and further development of the movement",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.02.006,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
327,The origin and mission of Material Religion,"Beginning its sixth year of publication, Material Religion is an interdisciplinary journal that seeks to gather the best work from around the world engaged in materializing the study of religions. The editors welcome original scholarship on any religion and from any period in human history that treats material objects and practices as primary evidence and engages in critical reflection on the cultural construction of materiality. In this article the editors reflect on the formation and format of the journal, the force and direction of its articles and other features, the question of what constitutes the material culture of religion, and finally the role of materiality in the current study of religions. Along the way, the editors consider new theories and concerns that have been taken up in the journal's pages and address the range of disciplines and interests that are represented in the different departments of the journal",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2010.01.010,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
328,"Responding to disasters within the Christian tradition, with reference to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes","Particularly within Christianity and Judaism, theodicy is defined as any attempt to reconcile notions of a loving and just God with the reality of human suffering. The paper begins with a review of the ways in which the Hebrew and Christian scriptures (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) have interpreted disasters, particularly those caused by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Theological analysis of disasters did not end at the close of the biblical era, but has continued throughout Christian history and a number of so called Leibnizian philosophical models of theodicy have been developed. These are critically introduced. In the past few decades there has been a sea‐change in both Christian attitudes towards disasters and in the ways in which losses are viewed by hazard researchers. From the perspective of the latter, an approach that envisions disasters as being primarily caused by extreme physical events has been largely replaced by one in which disasters are studied as social constructs, with a greater emphasis being placed on human vulnerability. Academic scholarship on the Leibnizian philosophical models continues, but greater prominence is now given to viewing disasters as events that represent human sinfulness which is manifested in national and international disparities in wealth, poverty, hazard preparedness and disaster losses. Finally, it is proposed that these new hazard analytical and theological perspectives are synergetic: allowing on the one hand churches, their members as well as their leaders, more fully to engage in disaster relief; whilst, on the other, enabling civil defence planners more effectively to use the often considerable human and financial resources of Christian communities and their charitable agencies",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.12.005,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
329,Recovery and Buddhist practices in the aftermath of the Tsunami in Southern Thailand,"For most Thai people, Buddhism serves as a base for explanations about life and death. This article focuses on Buddhist practices and the importance of ceremonies in the recovery process after the 2004 tsunami in Southern Thailand. The tsunami had devastating consequences for most people in the coastal regions. First, through the loss of life, and second, through the damage to and loss of houses, fishing boats and means of livelihood. This article analyses informants' experiences, narratives, interpretations and actions in terms of their Buddhist beliefs. The key findings of this article are that collective ceremonies form an important part of the recovery process. One finding revealed that, in cases of ambiguous loss, a Buddhist ceremony that was unknown to most people before the tsunami became an important element of the search for missing persons. Another finding is that the common Buddhist practice of communicating across the boundary between the living and dead became the most important ritual among the surviving relatives. The ethnography is based on a long‐term anthropological research project with in‐depth interviews, life stories and participant observation carried out in coastal villages located mainly in Phang Nga, the worst hit province in Thailand.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.12.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
330,Context‐bound Islamic theodicies: The tsunami as supernatural retribution vs. natural catastrophe in Southern Thailand,"After the tsunami of 26 December 2004, local discourses in the prevalently Muslim Satun province in Southern Thailand were characterized by religious interpretations of the disaster. The range of Islamic interpretations varied, and was far from homogeneous. Statements are framed in plural theodicies and ultimately impute disasters to human responsibility, in apparent contrast to both scientific explanations and other Islamic tenets. The aim of this article is to present the range of theodicies associated with the event and to analyze their use in relation to the specific socio‐historical and ethno‐political context, in the words of people belonging to the Islamic and Buddhist religious é lites. In these examples religious discourses leave behind the theological universalistic explanations of the existence of suffering and evil to become context‐bound commentaries on the state of morality of local communities, with the aim of defining social boundaries",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.12.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
331,Anthropology of religion: Disasters and the representations of tradition and modernity,"Based on ethnographic research, this article explores local explanations for and interpretations of the earthquake which occurred on the island of Java, Indonesia in May 2006, costing 6000 lives and leaving about 1 million people homeless. Although everybody knows that the disaster was the result of tectonic activity, this knowledge co‐exists with religious beliefs in manifold ways. The most widespread accounts of the earthquake referred to local myths connected to the landscape. The spirits are said to have sent the disaster in order to remind the Javanese ‐ and most importantly the Sultan and other people in power ‐ of their traditions. Several rituals were invented to prevent more misery, and certain experts thereby gained considerable importance. The various ways in which people shaped, interpreted and negotiated the meaning of the disaster are interconnected with their understanding of tradition and modernity. This article argues that ‐ whereas Javanese culturewas based on an image of the reconciliation of these spheres before ‐ the discourse on the earthquake reveals a newtendency to polarise: on the one handmodernity is associated with secularisation, materialism, moral decay and ecological exploitation, while on the other hand tradition is idealised according to a global model of spirituality and harmony. Thus, the main argument of this paper is that the culturalisation of a natural event brings both cultural and transcultural dynamics to light",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.12.004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
332,"The panoptic gaze in a non‐western setting: Self‐surveillance on Merapi volcano, Central Java","Jeremy Bentham's late eighteenth century concept of the ‘panopticon’, popularized by Foucault two centuries later, has become a ubiquitous model for thinking about not merely surveillance but selfsurveillance in the modern state. Foucault's analysis of the panopticon, and indeed perhaps the panopticon itself, is tied to a particular time and place of state development. What are the implications for this scholarship of different, non‐western traditions of state surveillance? An effort is made to answer this questions drawing on a body of beliefs about volcanic hazard from the Sultanate of Yogyakarta in Central Java. It is believed that there is a spirit world inside the crater of Merapi volcano that mirrors the world of humans. By monitoring the volcano, it is thought that insight can be gained into what is happening in the everyday world. These beliefs thus represent a model for monitoring, for surveillance, for self‐surveillance. The ways that this both resembles and differs from Bentham's and Foucault's model of the panopticon offers new insights into the cultural and historical dimensions of our current understandings of the state gaze. This analysis will also offer new insights into the applicability of Foucault's work on surveillance and governance in non‐western contexts",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.12.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
333,Charting the map metaphor in theories of religion,"The idea that scholars of religion produce ‘maps' that represent the ‘territories' of religion(s) is common and influential. This paper first discusses the role of the metaphor, with special reference to the work of J.Z. Smith, and some of the problems raised by the map metaphor (above all, its implicit reliance on a naive correspondence view of truth). It then draws two important distinctions: between different levels of representation; and between the representing and guiding function of maps (truth and use). It ends by comparing issues in the philosophy of science and the theory of religion in order to highlight some promising directions for more defensible semantic and epistemological groundwork in theory of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.010,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
334,The richness of ordinary life: Religious justification among Chile's business elite,"Based on the analysis of 75 in‐depth interviews with managers and businessmen of Chile's main economic conglomerates, this article is concerned with the justification, on religious and moral grounds, of the establishment of a neo‐liberal economic model during Augusto Pinochet's regime (1973–1989) and, most importantly, with the representation of business as a religious vocation. The value granted to wealth creation as a path to salvation, as formulated by the conservative religious movements Opus Dei and the Legionaries of Christ, is one possible response to the Church's call in Vatican II for the greater involvement of the laity in their cultures and societies. In the context of an increase in pluralism during the 1960s and 1970s, the perceived shift of the Catholic Church to the Left, and the threat that the political project of Salvador Allende's socialist government (1970–1973) posed to the elite's centenary lifestyle, the practice of more conservative forms of Catholicism has allowed for a restoration of the historical bond between the elite and its religious tradition. The case of Chile's elite can be seen as an example of an increase in pluralism which does not lead to a weakening of religious belief and practice, but to their strengthening.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.04.011,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
335,Body pedagogics and the religious habitus: A new direction for the sociological study of religion,"Sociological theory has been central to the modern study of religion. In the face of the global resurgence of religious phenomena, however, and the challenge this has presented for the assumptions that characterised much twentieth century sociology, there is a need for new theoretical models to make sense of religion today. This paper contributes to this task by building upon Durkheim's suggestion that religious social facts become fully efficacious only when internalised, and Luhmann's interest in sociological manifestations of ‘transcendence’ and ‘immanence’, in order to analyse religion as a thoroughly embodied phenomenon that can be understood through the study of religious body pedagogics. Having outlined the key steps involved in the analysis of body pedagogics, we illustrate the utility of this realist framework through an ideal-typical representation of Christianity and Islam and reflect, via a consideration of several objections that could be directed towards it, upon how this approach can deal with the complexities and contingencies of contemporary religion. In conclusion, it is suggested that this systematic body pedagogic focus on embodied commonalities and differences across diverse religious contexts offers a valuable basis upon which to engage critically with religion today.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.07.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
336,Searching for salvation: An analysis of US religious searching on the World Wide Web,"The goals of this research were to answer three questions. How predominant is religious searching online? How do people interact withWeb search engines when searching for religious information? How effective are these interactions in locating relevant information? Specifically, referring to a US demographic, we analyzed five data sets from Web search engine, collected between 1997 and 2005, of over a million queries each in order to investigate religious searching on the Web. Results point to four key findings. First, there is no evidence of a decrease in religious Web-searching behaviors. Religious interest is a persistent topic of Web searching. Second, those seeking religious information on the Web are becoming slightly more interactive in their searching. Third, there is no evidence for a move away from mainstream religions toward non-mainstream religions since the majority of the search terms are associated with established religions. Fourth, our work does not support the hypothesis that traditional religious affiliation is associated with lower adoption of or sophistication with technology. These factors point to theWeb as a potentially usefully communication medium for a variety of religious organizations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.07.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
337,The making of a sacred mountain. Meanings of nature and sacredness in Sápmi and northern Norway,"A case study of sacred landscapes in the contemporary era, the article deals with a particular mountain and its rise to sacredness. Fuelled by plans of ski‐slope development, the fate of Tromsdalstind caused a lively debate in local newspapers, as well as a report issued by the Sami Parliament. The report connected sacredness to Sami traditions in the past and to current laws on the protection of Sami cultural memories. This, then, was a case of sacredness constructed outside the context of organized religions and ongoing religious traditions, as well as a case of using secular laws as the primary basis for definitions of sacredness. Through this process, love for the mountain appears to have grown deeper and more religious, both for the Sami as well as for other northern Norwegians. Neither more nor less authentic than those of the past, these concepts of sacredness belong to the late modern world of law culture, nature romanticism, and to pan‐indigenous spirituality as a ‘‘religion’’ in the making.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.011,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-40
338,"When cognitive scientists become religious, science is in trouble: On neurotheology from a philosophy of science perspective","Since the 1990s medical technology has afforded exciting possibilities for studying the brain. Together with knowledge accrued through psychology and psychiatry, it has set the stage for pioneering research and stimulated disciplines such as Social Neuroscience, the Cognitive Science of Religion, Cognitive Anthropology, and Cognitive Archaeology. Another discipline has arisen, Neurotheology, which is interested in the brain and religious experience. Early proponents such as d’Aquili and Newberg had a religious agenda in their work. Others, such as members of Transcendental Meditation, have used experimental and brain studies to legitimate religious agendas. Experiential shamanists have embarked on a similar legitimation process. The differences between science and therapy and spirituality have been blurred or denied. Neurotheological attempts to discover areas of the brain responsible for religious experiences have led to untenable results. The fact that such research has passed the peer review process of leading psychological, psychiatric, and neurological journals is perhaps more indicative of the pervasiveness of religiosity throughout American society than of objective brain science. This essay argues that neurotheology is an example of the struggle between confessional and critical approaches to the study of religion. The main difference is that the battlefield of this struggle is the brain.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
339,d'Aquili and Newberg's neurotheology: A hermeneutical problem with their neurological solution,"In recent years there has been an increasing interest in scientifically understanding the neurological grounds for religious or mystical experiences and two researchers who have focused on this area are Eugene d’Aquili and Andrew B. Newberg. In their work, The Mystical Mind: Probing the Biology of Religious Experience (d’Aquili and Newberg, 1999), they contend that as a result of a similar‐in‐kind neurological deafferentation that leads to a dissolution of the sense of ‘self’ and unification with what they term Absolute Being mystical religious experiences can be classified as similar in kind across mystical traditions. In fact, they state that the conceptual description of the mystical state is derivative after the experience and results in the similarity of phenomenological description for these experiences (d'Aquili and Newberg, 1999, p. 165). To the contrary I hope to show that the conceptual framework from within which the mystic views the experience not only colors the experience, but leads to a hermeneutical component that differentiates the phenomenal feel of said mystical experience and that a neurological foundation for this can be found in the notion of the brain as plastic and embodied.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
340,Explanation and interpretation in the comparative study of religion,"According to Kuhn (1970), one of the real stumbling blocks in the advancement of a science is the question of adequate and legitimate theorizing when a science passes from one phase, or paradigm, to another. The study of religion now seems to have gone from the formative, descriptive ‘what?’ phase to the theoretically more interesting ‘how?’ phasedthe one that focuses on relations between religion and other mattersdtypically formulated in conference titles such as ‘religion and gender’, ‘religion and violence’ etc. Lately, in the study of religion ‘why?’ phase and ‘why?’ issues that are characteristic of ‘mature’ sciences have surfaced with renewed intensity. ‘Why?’ questions are typically explanatory in the more causal sense and explain the occurrence and evolution of the object of study. In the study of religion this is now evident especially in the cognitive approaches. There are, however, other possibilities for explanatory avenues than those most frequently copied from the natural sciences. On the relations between explanation and interpretation I propose a revised stance that is supported by theoretical and philosophical developments that seem to have been overlooked by scholars of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39

However, apart from a highly critical article by Nancy Frankenberry and Hans Penner (1999) little attempt has been made to investigate this understanding of religion as model. This paper briefly considers the validity of Frankenberry and Penner's criticism and investigates possible applications of the elaborate analysis of models and metaphors in the philosophy of science since the time of Mary Hesse to the analysis of religious phenomena.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.009,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
342,"Reduction, integrated theory, and the study of religion","The philosophy of science helps us to sort out and evaluate conflicting claims about reduction. Some persons maintain that reductions can be useful in constructing theories in science. Others hold that, with certain possible exceptions, reductions are likely to prove unproductive as well as inelegant. Such disagreements sometimes turn on differences in the scale or scope of the reductions envisioned. A promising strategy is to subsume considerations of reduction into efforts to find compatibilities among the claims and theoretical constructs of different disciplines. The postulation of compatibilities, advanced under rubrics such as ‘unified theory’, ‘consilience’, and ‘integrated theory’, holds great promise for studies of religion undertaken with reference to the contemporary cognitive and evolutionary sciences. Numbers of such studies view religious phenomena as, in part, expressions of evolved capacities and propensities that are not themselves necessarily religious.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
343,Kuhn and the science of religion,"Ever since the challenge to the ‘received’ view of the philosophy of scienceda view epitomized by Karl Popper and Carl Hempeldthe status of science has been questioned. If radical critics of the received viewdcritics including Kuhn, Laudan, Feyerabend, the Edinburgh Strong Programme, and Latourdare right, can science, which means natural science, still be considered objective? Can it still be deemed the model of objectivity to be emulated by the social sciences and even by the humanities? Because religious studies is commonly assumed to fall short of the standards of objectivity of the natural sciences and even of the social sciences, what bearing does criticism of conventional philosophy of science have on it? Specifically, can the religionist approach to religion, the approach that purports to be the sole appropriate one for religious studies, be defended? Does radical philosophy of science, by challenging the objectivity of scientific claims, make the world safe for religious ones? This article will focus on the philosophy of Thomas Kuhn and will seek to determine what use defenders of religious studies can make of it.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.005,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39

345,Contemporary religious studies and science—A postcritical witches' brew,"The six preceding essays are written at different levels and range over a complex set of issues which are representative of the methodological and theoretical disorder one finds in religious studies, today. So disordered is religious studies that it should be considered pre‐scientific (perhaps like Alchemy), instead of a science. However, out of these essays, a common set of themes emerge. These are: contextualism, reduction, scientific or critical realism, explanation, and scientific models. An examination of the arguments of each of the preceding essays shows a wide variety of views, although two general positions can be discerned: on one hand, the reductionist‐contextualist‐realist position is (approximately) occupied by Geertz, Goldberg, Saler, and Segal, on the other hand, the anti‐reductionist‐contextualistconstructivist position is (approximately) occupied by Jensen and Rennie. To conclude, the author of this response paper makes an argument for a scientific approach to the study of religions which is moderately reductionist, contextualist, and critical realist but one which is also capacious enough to include hermeneutical explanation and the role of models in religious studies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.08.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39

The methodology of conversation analysis is compared with the methods of the ethnography of reading. The conversation analytical perspective is demonstrated through examining some recurrent practices of talking about Bible texts in Seventh-day Adventist Bible study, namely, recontextualizing words and expressions, and inferences about the characters and events in the texts. The article shows how interactional practices are analyzed as both situated and recurrent. In the concluding section a suggestion is made for how the perspectives of ethnography and conversation analysis can be combined.

Based on ethnographic research of contemporary pilgrimage to the Rebbe's court in Brooklyn, whose rituals and pedagogical framework are constructed by the meshichistim, the study problematizes the functional assumptions and implications of the rich literature on failed prophecies in millenarian movements, a literature heavily influenced by the theoretical model of cognitive dissonance. The case of Chabad meshichistim suggests that a millenarian group can reinvent itself through multifaceted cultural, pedagogical and ritual endeavors that are rife with internal contradictions. Moreover, these endeavors reveal that the rupture has not been balanced, regularized or normalized, but rather expresses the continuous complexity of life in its shadow.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.015,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39

349,Dangerous love in mythical narratives and formula tales,"The theme of love has long been neglected in studies on African myths. The often-heard explanation is that African myths and folktales do not tell stories about love because they primarily express social interests and obligations while love ‐ intended as both emotional imperative and biological drive ‐ is an individual need and feeling. This latter definition relies on a very specific understanding of ‘love’: the Romantic love of 19th century European novels. This paper argues that when love means attraction, affection, passion, and necessity, it turns up as liaisons dangereuses in many African narratives. Love becomes a driving force that generates gender constructions by reinforcing the unity of the couple or by fuelling the struggle between partners. In the case of Kabyle narratives (Algeria),1 conceptualisations of love as well as the relationships between myths and folktales are explored by analyzing formula tales2 and the only known collection of Kabyle Berber myths: those collected by Leo Frobenius, ethnologist and historian of religion, at the beginning of the 20th century and published in the first volume of his Volksmarchen der Kabylen in 1921. The discussion of the relationship between Kabyle myths and folktales touches upon a well-known interpretative problem in the study of religion: the articulation of myth and ritual with history as communities respond to sweeping social, political, and religious changes, such as the coming of Islam, colonization, decolonization, and globalization.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.05.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39

His association with the Kali temple at Daksineshvar, in the northern suburb of Calcutta, has no doubt been a powerful argument behind his Shakta/Tantrika affiliation. This paper argues that Ramakrishna was essentially a bhakta (devotee) in the Vaisnava tradition and his cultural and family inheritance. His idea of the divine and his career and logia as a priest and a saint provide ample justification to consider him essentially a Vaisnava whose spiritual battle‐cry was to demand to have dalliance with God.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.12.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39

Based on the articles of the special issue, the article introduces two meso-levels of investigation: regional and local studies, bridging the gap between the national level (the hitherto preferred level of aggregation) and the study of single groups.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.006,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
352,Religions in Europe,"The breakdown of European society is changing rapidly, particularly in the field of religion. Culture is of vital importance to the presence of religion in all nations. Religions also have exerted a certain degree of political power, thus influencing the economy and other related spheres of life. The different religions in Europe exhibit a variety of attitudes towards religious pluralism. The religious differences between Western and Eastern Europe depend mainly on issues of national identity related to religious adherence. This essay provides an overview of religion and politics, or Church and state, in Europe. It will conclude with some reflections about possible future developments within religious traditions in Europe. New religious communities and religious organisations are reaching different parts of Europe, sometimes very far from their place of origin. Christianity (Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism) is the most widespread religion in contemporary Europe. Catholic religion is well diffused in Europe, but there are substantial differences in belief, behaviour and practice within different Catholic communities. There are various branches of Orthodoxy in Europe, such as the distinct autocephalous churches. In general Orthodox religion is closely aligned with national culture. Islam is also present in Western countries, and its impact is evident.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.017,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
353,Regional approaches to religion: Christianity in Norway,"The topic of regionalisation is debated within European politics and Academia, but its topicality is hardly reflected in the History of Religions, in spite of the fact that a region may be an explicit or implicit spatial category in many studies of religion. This article sketches some understandings of the concept of region and approaches to regional studies among contemporary historians, geographers and others. In addition, some of the connections ‐ actual or imagined ‐ between regions and religion are discussed, exemplified by the regional impact of two popular religious movements in Norway.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.013,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
354,A softer God and a more positive anthropology: Changes in a religiously strict region in Norway,"This is a report from an on-going project. Based mainly at the University of Agder, Norway, this research project involves over 20 full- and part-time researchers in studying religious change in the Sø rlandet or Agder region in Norway. This article, written by the project director, aims mainly to summarize some of the main empirical results. In sum, the empirical studies show that in the last few decades the strict Christian movements in the region have moved in a more liberal direction, especially concerning lifestyle issues. Towards the end the article also presents some reflections on the dynamics of change in religious organizations with a conservative self-understanding, as well as on the interplay between such a project and the regional discourse on religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
355,"What are the impacts of religious diversity? A review of the methodological considerations and empirical findings of a research project on religious pluralisation in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","In the first place, this article offers a brief insight into the state of contemporary research on religious diversity and some of its methodological problems. Second, a multi-dimensional model is suggested in order to measure religious diversity. Thus, one can distinguish between different degrees of diversity allowing one to examine the results obtained both for the field of religious communities and in terms of their social implications. In a third step, the first results of a research project on religious diversity in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, and some of its impacts on the religious field are presented. One of the most important outcomes of this project is the finding that there is no evidence to support the thesis that religious diversity would lead to increased participation in religious organisations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.014,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
356,Multi-religiosity in the Canary Islands: Analysing processes of religious change between continents,"This article is made possible by the research program of the group RELICAN (Religions in the Canaries), which is devoted to the study of multi-religiosity in the Canary Islands. The aim of the group is to analyse the different religious components implied in the configuration of the present diversity of the Canarian religious field. In this exposition, the tri-continental geo-strategic position of the Canary Islands is understood to be of critical importance as the islands form an archipelago located near the coast of Africa, but they are closer to Europe from a cultural and political point of view, and they are also closely linked to Ibero-America (and to the whole American continent) in many respects. Christianity is the primary European religious tradition in the Canaries, and it has many faces: Catholicism maintains an undeniably powerful influence but the presence of Protestant churches continues to increase both for foreigners and tourists (mainly from European countries) and also for Spaniards who convert to non-Catholic Christian churches. African religious perspectives have been reinforced as a result of immigration: Islam is the second most prominent religion in the Canaries due to the importance of Moroccan immigration, but also due to the increasing presence of Senegalese, Mauritanian and other Muslim immigrants. The impact of American religious traditions is increasing not only due to immigration from Ibero- America but also because of the influence of Pentecostals, Baptists, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and other American (i.e. U.S.) models of being Christian. The problems and challenges that are particular to this field of research are examined and revised in the last part of the article from an analytical perspective that has as its focus the local‐global implications of the religious changes taking place in the Canaries.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
357,From locality to location and back again: A spatial journey in the study of religion,"In this article, in the context of a retrospective examination of my own research journey from locality to location and back again, I argue for the importance and value of studying religion in local perspective, and reconceptualize ‘locality’ from the perspective of a spatial methodology, in recognition of the critiques made of earlier usage and the demands placed on the term in the context of globalization. Using the example of an urban high street, I put a spatially-informed approach to the study of religion in locality to work. I suggest that such an approach counterbalances and challenges the once dominant perspective in Religious Studies that focused on World Religions and saw the places in which they occurred as little more than mere context. A locality-based approach seeks to reconnect religion with other social and cultural fields and to recognise the impact of local particularity on the religious life of an area.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
358,Learning from experience: The value of analysing Avalon,"In this article some of the experiences and insights gained from roughly fifteen years of conducting a long term study of Glastonbury are examined. Glastonbury, a small town in the south west of England, has become a multivalent pilgrimage site for a variety of spiritual seekers, and an icon of integrative spirituality (my preferred term for ‘alternative’ or ‘New Age’ spirituality). The concept of vernacular religion is explained, and its appropriateness in relation to both place-centred study and research into integrative spirituality is demonstrated. The rationale and some of the methodological complexities underlying this type of study are explored, and some of the trends and phenomena that the long term observation of one location has revealed are considered. The contextual detail and depth of knowledge gained from such long term study feed into an appreciation of both the internal dynamics of Christianity in Glastonbury, for example, and the growing institutionalisation of the Glastonbury Goddess movement and the spread of its influence through a variety of conduits. The role of the internet in framing expectations and presentations of Glastonbury is examined, and research relating to its unique spiritual service industry is briefly summarised. While Glastonbury is by no means ‘typical’, it is indicative of a number of trends in relation to ‘integrative’ spirituality and therefore lessons learned from there can have wider implications for the study of phenomena increasingly common in the contemporary milieu.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.016,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
359,"Religious diversity beyond the cosmopolis: Immigration and the religious field in the City of Turku, Finland","International migration has fundamentally changed local population demographics in many corners of the world. This article discusses the religious implications of an increase in the population of immigrant origin in the city of Turku, Finland, which serves as an example of a regional immigration centre. Migration started at the turn of the 1990s and by 2006, about 9% of the city's population were first and second generation migrants with backgrounds mainly in Europe and Asia. The main countries of origin are Russia, Iraq, former Yugoslavia and Estonia. The migrants have brought increasing religious diversity to the local religious fields, including internal diversification of membership in many Christian churches (Lutheran, Protestant free church, Orthodox and Catholic), and have founded new Muslim, Buddhist and Mandaean congregations. This article argues that the founding of religious organisations is a main form of structural adaptation to the local social context. In addition, there is a discussion of religious activities and transnational connections in relation to immigration, as well as, the local, national and transnational implications of increasing globality.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.005,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39

This article sets out the initial findings of a project that is studying this new religious diversity in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon. In this sense, the principal aim is to show the first broad outlines of the new religious plurality in Lisbon.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2009.01.018,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
361,"Candanbālā's hair: Fasting, beauty, and the materialization of Jain wives","Jain discourse on the body provides us with an opportunity to examine complex choreographies of ritual acts, which materialize the Jain body. The incipient moment of moving into womanhood is a key place for the materialization of wifely bodies. In order to understand this materialization, we must consider the ways in which discourses (here of wife-hood and nun-hood) shape the transition of Jain young women's bodies into the expected bodies (wives). The acceptance of the performative nature of the body among Jains allows us to examine the ways that Jain young women negotiate the seemingly contradictory discourses of wife-hood and nun-hood into bodies constitutive of both. Body practices suggest ways to explore the intersection of competing discourses and to destabilize the boundaries between them. In the Candanbālā Fast, Jain ritualized hair practices manifest the bodies (shaved nun and the luxurious long-haired bride) more overtly and the focus on the reiteration of the presence and discourse of loose, lovely hair enables these young women to negotiate the terrain of these seeming poles while maintaining the stated virtue of the celibate nun and the promise of the sexual and fertile wife.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.10.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
362,Mizuko kuyō in the abortion cultural wars: The rhetorical appropriation of Japanese Buddhism by non-Buddhist Americans,"Mizuko kuyō, the popular Japanese Buddhist memorial service for aborted fetuses, has been increasingly appropriated by both sides of the contentious American abortion debate. In the wake of exposure to the idea of mizuko kuyō, both pro-life and pro-choice Buddhist appropriators resort to discussions of the ritual because they feel it helps them strengthen the weaknesses of their own sides and undermine the positions of their opponents. Prolife Americans use mizuko kuyō to prove that they care about women, not just fetuses, and that their convictions do not arise simply out of private religious feelings but objective psychological and medical facts. Pro-choice Americans, on the other hand, use mizuko kuyō to demonstrate that they care about families and children, not just women, and that they are sensitive not only to the secular but also the religious aspects of life and abortion. In the process, pro-life Christians, who seem to be primarily motivated by their exclusivist and authoritarian Biblical convictions, turn for support to a non-theistic religion they otherwise oppose; pro-choice feminists, who seem to have chiefly secular reasons for supporting abortion rights, turn for support to a supernatural entity and his retinue of angry fetal ghosts",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.05.006,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
363,The paradox of healing pain,"Pain may be seen as a problem to be healed or as a means for healing. The secular biomedical view of pain is that it is to be avoided and alleviated; its only meaning is as a symptom of underlying disease. In contrast, there have been throughout history other views of sufferingdas redemptive or as transformative, for example. This paper considers the disparity between these perspectives, examining the role of the emotions and the underlying neurobiological processes though which pain and suffering come to be experienced as meaningful, then analyzes interview material exploring how religion and religious beliefs help people cope with suffering or with pain. The experience of pain is subjective, enculturated experience; the meaning that pain or suffering holds within a given cultural context affects the experience of pain and suffering. In a context where pain and suffering are understood to be valuable, those experiences can be used for spiritual transformation and integrated within a meaningful identity. In contrast, in a context where pain and suffering are not understood to have value, that attitude can create more suffering, even in conditions meant to alleviate suffering, such as in biomedical situations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.03.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
364,New Testament studies in the 20th century,"Considered diachronically, NT studies in the twentieth century is a story of vigorous scholarship. Especially after World War II, there is increasing diversification in approach and in the makeup of scholars, with a noticeable shift of centre to English-speaking settings (especially North America), and greater involvement of Roman Catholic, Evangelical, and Jewish scholars, a growing prominence of women, and a proliferation of approaches.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.03.006,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
365,Is Scripture the origin of the Halakhah?,"Scripture, in particular the Pentateuch, forms the natural starting point for any inquiry into origins in Judaism. The question answered here derives from a simple fact: the Pentateuch is privileged within the Rabbinic system, which links as much of the Halakhah to the Pentateuchal law codes as it possibly can. So it is quite natural to treat Scripture as the base-line and the Halakhic category-formations as the variable, in seeking the origin of the system. But what happens when we treat the system as the base-line and Scripture as the variable? Then we see that the Halakhic system viewed as a coherent statement does not originate in Scripture. Scripture is not the origin of the Halakhah. Why not? Because of this paradox: Scripture is necessary for the Halakhic system. But Scripture is insufficient for the Halakhic system. The Halakhic system is necessary for Scripture. The Halakhic system is sufficient without Scripture. It requires only Scripture's facts ‐ and these on their own form no system.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.03.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
366,Richard Rorty and the pragmatic turn in the study of religion,"Recent interest in the pragmatic tradition draws much of its impetus fromthework of Richard Rorty and his critics. This paper argues that Rorty's late interest in religion derives from his abiding interests in American liberalism and not specifically from his Pragmatism. Students of religion, however, have much to learn from the pragmatic tradition and over the last 25 years work by Wayne Proudfoot, Jeffrey Stout, and others has been important in establishing a pluralist approach to the study of religion that avoids the pitfalls of foundationalism, essentialism, and dogmatism in understanding religion and religious phenomena. The continued pursuit of this approach, the essay concludes, will help students of religion avoid unnecessary worries about theories and methods.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.12.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-39
367,Symbols of Diaspora Jewish identity: An international survey and multi-dimensional analysis,"Symbols are important in representing religious and ethnic identity, particularly in the postmodern age. Using a case study of Jewish adolescents, this article explores the use of symbols in expressing identity. A structural typology of symbols is developed, based on responses to a list of 20 symbols of Jewish identity by over 40,000 Jewish youth from around the world, who were surveyed during educational tours to Israel. The multi-dimensional smallest space analysis (SSA) technique is used to develop the typology by graphically representing the correlations between the symbols. Symbols representing the struggle of the weak against the strong are at the core of the typology. This core is surrounded by sets of symbols related to religion, family, Israel, the Holocaust, justice, and contribution to world culture. A parallel centre‐periphery structure indicates that people are more central symbols than places or objects. Sub-populations of self-defined ``religious´´ and ``non-religious´´Jewish youth are compared in relation to this typology of symbols by introducing them into the SSA as ``external variables´´. Applications of the typology of symbols to other ethnic and religious groups are explored.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.03.010,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
368,The study of religion(s) in Western Europe (II): Institutional developments after World War II,"This essay discusses main features and developments of the study of religion(s) inWestern Europe. It attempts a historical, geographical, and thematic synthesis. Part II sketches institutional developments after World War II in several countries and the emergence of professional associations (international as well as national). In the post World War II growth of the field, social-scientific approaches to the study of religion(s) became increasingly prominent. The article sketches the institutional developments and main scholarly concerns of the psychology, sociology, and anthropology of religions respectively. It then moves on to consider the Eranos conferences as a specific forum for scholarship.

369,Prologue: Encounters with Mircea Eliade and his legacy for the 21st century,"To mark the centennial of Mircea Eliade, the articles in this special issue of Religion analyze various aspects of his life and his scholarship, and suggest what may be of value in Eliade's legacy for the study of religion in the 21st century. In my study, using one of Eliade's favorite terms, ‘the encounter,’ I suggest what my encounters with Eliade reveal about Eliade, his scholarship, and especially his legacy. By delineating and analyzing encounters that were remarkable, disturbing, complex, and contradictory, we may assess both strengths and weaknesses in Eliade's history and phenomenology of religion and what remains in Eliade's legacy that may be of value for the contemporary study of religion. Although Eliade's influence has certainly waned, my position is that there is much of value in his legacy, often in need of more critical reformulation, that offers a valuable critique of much of contemporary scholarship, provides valuable insights, and can serve as a catalyst allowing us to rethink our approaches to the study of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.05.015,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
370,Mircea Eliade: ‘Secular mysticism’ and the history of religions,"This essay considers the origins of theoretical understanding in lived experience and the implications this principle might have on our understanding of Mircea Eliade's approach to religion. It inspects possible sources of Eliade's theoretical understanding of religion in his descriptions of his lived experience and considers whether specifically ‘religious' experience would be most likely to be determinative. This necessitates some analysis of the relation of experience to expressions of that experience and of the iterations of the scholar using one to elucidate the other. It suggests that the scholar's own understanding must be open to transformation rather than automatically redescribing the expressions of subjects of research. The main claim of the article is that Eliade can be appropriately termed a ‘secular mystic’ because of the effective openness that he maintains to the transformative potential of the experience of the world of the other. The Eliadean identification of the sacred and the real, far from being a normative assumption, is a principle of hermeneutical openness, comparable in secular terms to openness to mystical experience.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.05.016,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
371,‘The Trojan horse of philosophia perennis’: Mircea Eliade's quest of spiritual transformation,This essay highlights one of Mircea Eliade's most important legacies to Religious Studies. The Romanian scholar never reduced the spiritual history of humankind to a mere socio-cultural construction. He defended his stance against the naturalist scholars and resisted the stream of ‘scientific atheism’ that is now towering above Religious Studies departments. The article also underlines Eliade's early intellectual influences and his idea of ‘creative hermeneutics’. I hope that this essay will contribute to a better understanding of Eliade's philosophical presuppositions.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.06.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
372,Eliade on diplomatic service in London,"It was in England that Mircea Eliade started writing the volume which would be published nearly a decade later as Traite d’histoire des religions (Patterns in Comparative Religion), as attested by the book's Avant-propos de l’auteur, dated ‘Oxford 1940/Paris 1948.’ Eliade also states in his autobiography (1988, p. 84) that ‘I read, took notes, and elaborated a plan of a vast synthesis of the morphology and history of religions, a synthesis I had glimpsed instantaneously in an air raid shelter during an alarm.’ In order to recreate the historical and political environment in which Eliade conceived and began to write his fundamental theoretical book, I have sketched the history of Great Britain's early involvement in World War II, the dramatic political events in Romania during Eliade's diplomatic service in London, and the British government's intrigues that held him a virtual ‘captive’ from September 1940 to February 19411",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.05.017,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
373,Illud tempus in Greek myth and ritual,"This article offers a re-examination of Eliade's classic theory of rituals as repetitions of archetypal events that once upon a time took place in illo tempore. I confront the theory with ancient Greek myths and rituals, showing that it does fit them to some extent, although it needs to be modified and further elaborated. The Greeks were acutely aware of the ambivalence of mythical time, and their rituals were not just meant to evoke it but to keep it off as well. In myth things typically go wrong, and the task of ritual is to correct them, repeating the archetypal mistake in a non-literal way that makes it possible to relate to the mythical while leaving it safely detached behind the boundaries of the civilized world. The Greek vision of primordial time does not necessarily contradict the myth-and-ritual pattern proposed by Eliade, but it is interesting in that it emphasizes certain features of primordiality downplayed by him, thus inviting us to reconsider the meaning of the whole conception. This is what I attempt in the second part of my paper, in which I set the problem of ritual repetition in a different methodological perspective, interpreting it in accordance with contemporary, structuralist approaches to the study of Greek religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.05.014,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
374,The notion of archetype in Eliade's writings,"The notion of archetype is of crucial importance in Eliade's historical-religious perspective, although he never provides a clear definition. The aim of this paper is to discuss the origins of the notion of archetype and clarify its meanings. Starting from the first occurrences of the term ‘archetype’ in 1937, and taking into account the issue of the relations of the Eliadean archetype with those of C.G. Jung, K. Kerenyi, A.K. Coomaraswamy and E. D’Ors, three meanings of the notion of ‘archetype’ can be identified in his works, where it is used systematically since 1942. The first of these three meanings is the ‘descriptive’ meaning (the archetype as the expression of an ‘archaic ontology’, possessing a ‘Platonic structure’); the second is the ‘existential’ meaning (the archetype as a consequence of boundary situations that a human being discovers at the moment of reaching an awareness of his or her own position in the universe); the third is the ‘morphological’ meaning (the archetype as a structural and structuring element of the religious phenomenon). In order to understand the third concept, it is necessary to address the problem of the relation between Eliade's concept, J.W. Goethe's morphology and E. Husserl's philosophical phenomenology.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.07.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
375,"Rereading Mircea Eliade's Youth Without Youth, a story of suspicion and camouflage","The article argues that Mircea Eliade's 1976 novella Youth Without Youth (which has been recently turned into a film by Francis Ford Coppola) offers an intriguing literary illustration of the concept of ‘camouflage’ so prominent in Eliade's scholarly writings. Youth Without Youth, revolving around the paradoxes of aging and of (biological) time, develops as a fantastic reverie, a mysterious gnostic parable under the appearances of a work of science fiction, and ultimately becomes a sort of rebus, made up of a large number of suggested enigmas within enigmas. It is, at the same time, an opportunity for the author to revisit phantasmatically a dramatic period of his life ‐ the year 1938. Historical reality becomes fantastic, charged with symbols and riddles. The Eliadean dialectic between the sacred and the profane is interestingly doubled in this story by a dialectic between spying and hiding, surveillance and escape, suspicion and camouflage.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.05.013,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
376,Hinduism and cyberspace,"Hinduism is thriving in cyberspace. In this article I consider the suitability of this environment for Hinduism. This can indicate both whether various forms of Hindu religious expression online are valid and whether Hinduism needs to undergo any radical changes as a result of its presence in cyberspace. In order to investigate this issue I consider the nature of cyberspace and then discuss a number of key aspects of Hinduism in the light of this. I conclude that, overall, cyberspace appears to be a highly suitable environment for Hinduism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.01.008,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
377,‘At home in the uncanny’: Freud's account of das Unheimliche in the context of his theory of religious belief,"This paper serves as an exploration of Freud's comment that one of the functions of religious belief is to make humanity feel ‘at home in the uncanny’ (heimisch im Unheimlichen). The first section examines the context of Freud's comment within The Future of an Illusion. Attention is then shifted to Freud's essay on ‘The ‘‘Uncanny’’’, and to his conclusion that the ‘uncanny’ is the name for everything that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light. A number of interpretations of the ‘at home’ remark are discussed, and it is suggested that religion might fruitfully be viewed as an attempt to come to terms with humanity's ‘transcendental homelessness’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.04.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
378,The science of religious beliefs,"Why have humans, throughout history and across cultures, shown a strong tendency to believe in the existence of superhuman intentional agents and attached this belief to notions of morality, misfortune, and the creation of the world? The answer emerging from the cognitive science of religion appears to be that explicit beliefs are informed and constrained by the natural and cross-culturally recurrent operation of implicit cognitive systems. Successful god concepts resonate with the expectations of these implicit systems but also have attention-demanding and inferentially-rich properties that allow their integration into various areas of human concern. Theological concepts may deviate from these natural cognitive moorings but require special cultural scaffolding, such as Whitehouse's two Modes of Religiosity, to do so and constitute additions to, rather than replacements of the religious beliefs supported by implicit cognitive systems.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.01.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
379,"Ascription, attribution, and cognition in the study of experiences deemed religious","There have been two major approaches to the study of ‘religious experience’ in religious studies, which I refer to as the sui generis model and the ascriptive model. The sui generis model assumes, implicitly or explicitly, that there are specifically religious (or mystical or spiritual) experiences, emotions, acts, or objects; the ascriptive model assumes that there are not. I argue that the sui generis model holds little promise in terms of linking the study of religion and brain research, while the ascriptive model, presupposed by attributional theories of religion in social psychology, provides a means of linking the cognitive and cultural approaches to the study of religion. Classical attribution theories of religion [Proudfoot, W., Shaver, P., 1975. Attribution theory and the psychology of religion.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 24(1), 1e20], however, need to be updated in light of recent work in social cognition and social neuroscience to better understand those experiences that most challenge an attributional model: those that subjects experience as inherently religious. To get at this, we need to distinguish between attributions of causality and ascriptions of qualities; although the former are invariably conscious, something like the latter may take place below the threshold of consciousness. Psychological and neuroscientific research on involuntary experiences, such as dreaming and hallucinations, has the potential to clarify the role of conscious and non-conscious processes in the deeming of things religious.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.01.005,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
380,"Adaptation, evolution, and religion","Neo-Darwinian theories of religion include both nonadaptationist and adaptationist versions. Nonadaptationist versions contend that the mental architecture of the brain is wired for religious thinking but that religious concepts have piggybacked on other cognitive adaptations, especially those for agency detection. Religious concepts are not evolved biological adaptations but rather by-products of more general cognitive structures that are adaptations. Adaptationist versions concentrate on the benefits provided by religion, such as increased social cohesion and the individual benefits that stem from it, such as better physical and mental health and greater longevity. After clarifying the meaning of the terms ‘‘adaptation’’ and ‘‘adaptationism,’’ this article presents four lines of evidence in favor of the adaptationist position: (1) in the ancestral environment the role of the shaman was nearly universal and was primarily devoted to the crucial human goals of curing illness and protecting and finding vital resources; (2) religion generally has positive effects on both physical and mental health; (3) religions tend to be pro-natalist and more religious people tend to leave more offspring than less religious or nonreligious people; (4) the major world religions that evolved in the first millennium BCE during a period of major social chaos and disruption emphasized an omnipotent, transcendent God of love and mercy who offered salvation in a heavenly afterlife and released individuals from earthly suffering. None of these facts demonstrate conclusively that cognitive modules specifically oriented to supernatural agents evolved by natural selection, but they are highly suggestive and make a good inferential case.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.01.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38

382,William Robertson Smith: Sociologist or theologian?,"William Robertson Smith is often considered to be the first modern sociologist of religion. I argue that Smith was truly a pioneering sociologist of religion, but of ‘‘primitive’’ and ancient religion only. He pitted primitive and ancient religion against modern religion, which for him was religion of the individual rather than of the group. I suggest that Smith's sociologising of religion, as revolutionary as it was, stops short.

383,The Buddha counsels a theist: A reading of the Tevijjasutta (Dīghanikāya 13),"The dominant culture in India in the Buddha's day, Brahmanical culture, took as axiomatic the existence of a supernatural creator deity. This deity, termed ‘Brahmā, was conceived as being ‘the all-seeing, the allpowerful, the Lord, the maker and creator, ruler, appointer and orderer, father of all that have been and will be’. Although the Buddha completely rejected such apparent metaphysical speculation as a ‘thicket of views’, he nowhere formulated a systematic repudiation of theism. In one canonical text, however, the Buddha, encountering a young Brahmin espousing theistic beliefs, gives a series of analogies and similes that help to illuminate his views on the matter. In short, the Buddha saw such a belief as being dangerously reflexive, and hence as a symptom of a debilitating conceptual and affective disorder. Thus, in the dialogue, the Buddha aims to ease this ailment of his interlocutor through a threefold strategy: (1) displaying the language usage that under girds the problem; (2) reorienting the interlocutor towards the primacy of his conceptual apparatus as the proper locus of concern; and (3) providing a practice through which the interlocutor may develop the skills necessary for conceptual and affective health. The parameters of the discussion in this sutta are wide enough to render it of relevance to contemporary debates on theism. That is, the issue at stake in the sutta may be read as being not only about a restricted local notion of deity, but about God, broadly conceived. The article contains fresh translations from the text under consideration, the Tevijjasutta of the Dīhanikāya (13).",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.09.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
384,Dwelling on the hill: Impressions of residents of two favelas in Rio de Janeiro regarding religion and public space,"Drawing on fieldwork and interviews with residents in two favelas in Rio de Janeiro, this paper argues that the concept of ‘the divided city’ (fixed and nomadic, planned and negotiated, rich and poor) allows us to make sense of these residents' views of religion and public space. Life ‘on the hill’ is characterised by a greater degree of negotiation and improvisation in all its social relations than is life below in ‘the asphalt’. This offers important insights into the success of Evangelicals [Apart from here in the abstract, references to ‘evangelicals' in the text follow Brazilian usage, i.e., a broad term including three groups of Protestants: mainstream historical churches or ‘‘evangelicos de missão’’ (Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist, etc); Pentecostals (Assembleia de Deus, Congregacão Cristã, Deus é Amor, etc.); and Neo-pentecostals (Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus, Igreja da Graca de Deus, Igreja Aposto lica Renascer em Cristo, etc).(S.E./C.M.)] and Pentecostals, and the relative lack of success by Catholics, in taking a lead in public activities within the community. This finding may well have broader application. However, the paper makes a theoretical and methodological qualification: because the place of religion depends on the particular history and context of the location studied, the most pressing need is for more local studies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2008.01.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-38
385,"Myth, identity and belonging: The Rishi of Bengal/Bangladesh","This essay discusses the politics and relevance of myth and myth making in relation to the subordination of Untouchables in South Asia. Through the case study of one particular group e the Muchi-Rishi of Bengal/ Bangladesh, traditionally skinners, leather-workers and musicians e it is argued that ex-Untouchables do not share the ideology of caste which places them on the lowest echelon of society. This is in contrast with the case of ‘Untouchable myths of origin’ offered by anthropological research (Michael Moffatt, Robert Delie`ge) in South India, Tamil Nadu. However, another set of counter-myths recounted by the Rishi, centred around the figure of Ruidas, offers an alternative which allows them to gain a self-ascribed identity. Far from engaging in a ‘theological’ struggle, the idiom of religion and myth becomes for these ‘ex- Untouchables' and subaltern groups a ‘place of resistance’ from which they can hope to better themselves also in the economic, social and political spheres, as part of their overall endeavour to achieve full human dignity. For some Rishi, this process has taken the form of a long journey from being defined an ‘Untouchable’ to becoming a Dalit.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.10.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
386,Comparativism in the history of religions: Some models and key issues,"The purpose of this article is to defend a specific epistemological position, which the author places in the context of twomodes of comparativismfrequently practised in the comparative studies of some culturalproductions commonly subsumed under the adjective ‘religious’. These are, on the one hand, an anthropological/analogical comparison bent upon ‘generalizing’; on the other hand, a comparison of a historical type, which looks for ‘singularities’. Both are based on the distinction between the ‘universal’ and the ‘particular’. The author distances herself fromboth positions andmakes a plea for another one, called ‘differential comparativism’,which is based on the distinction between the ‘general’ and the ‘differential’. She submits that this third approach proves to be historically and empiricallymore firmly grounded, therefore epistemologicallymore fruitful.For the historianof religions, it has notably the advantage of serving as an efficient antidote against various risks. These risks are, namely, the essentialism which is implicit in any religiously, anti-historically oriented phenomenology; an also often implicit agnosticism; an empiricismlimited to themere, a-problematic description of the so-called religious phenomena; and, last but not least, an absolute cultural relativism. This form of comparativism, called ‘differential’, has already brought about remarkable results in the History of Religions, mainly thanks to the works of the scholars of the School of Rome founded by Raffaele Pettazzoni. The latter was, indeed, the first who successfully tried to reconcile the necessity of a truly historical knowledge of civilizations with the holistic and systemic procedures of cultural and social anthropology.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.10.004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37

It attempts a historical, geographical, and thematic synthesis. Part I sketches the general academic framework of the academic study of religion(s) in Western Europe and addresses the question of the (historical and conceptual) roots of this field of study. It then discusses some key dimensions of the academic institutionalization of the study of religion(s) from the 1870s to Fascism and National Socialism, addressing such issues as chairs, congresses, periodicals, textbooks and reviewing previous research.

388,Renunciation feminised? Joint renunciation of female–male pairs in Bengali Vaishnavism,"The Indic category of renunciation is generally constructed in radical opposition to that of householder/ worldly life (sam_ sāra), by actors and analysts alike. Yet, as an institution, renunciation is also traditionally modelled on householder structures. It is created through an idiom of ‘birth’ into patrilines, albeit generated through ‘guru’ rather than ‘blood’ lineages. These contrary facets of renunciation feature in the unusual Bengali Vaishnava phenomenon of joint renunciation of a femaleemale pair. On the one hand joint renunciation is ostensibly a matter of death to one (householder) patriline and of birth into another (renouncer) patriline. In this sense it is a male-oriented phenomenon, replicating householder structures. On the other hand Vaishnava renouncers also construct renunciation in opposition to householder life, that is, in terms of liminality and transcendence of categories. These characteristics are in turn identified as ‘female’ and are associated with a high valuation of women. Renunciation has often been considered a conservative or marginal force in South Asian society, although a few scholars have argued for its radical potential among subaltern groups. Studies of female renouncers have shown that the price of greater autonomy conferred by renunciation is often the virtual denial of ‘womanhood’ itself. My intention here is to highlight a shift in balance, in which renunciation is feminised in significant respects, with potentially liberating results for women. This suggests indigenous sources for ideas of gender equality or even female superiority, normally assumed to be of ‘Western’ provenance.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37

Sutcliffe, ‘‘Religious studies in Scotland: A persistent tension with divinity’’ [Religion 36 (1) (March 2006) 1e28]: A response from Religion at Stirling","A PhD student1 in our department who has a background in classical studies and is now researching the use of the World Wide Web by pagan groups was the first to see this survey on religious studies in Scotland. She felt worried at the time by the way the article misrepresented what we did at Stirling. Coming from another country to do postgraduate studies in religion here, she felt people in her country reading this journal would be given a false impression that could affect her career prospects. In particular the article stated that the typical orientation of the department at Stirling was ‘traditional textual-hermeneutical methodologies of Theology and Divinity’ when she, and subsequently the rest of us, felt this bore little relation to the breadth of what was actually being taught. Why was there no mention of the interdisciplinarity of our approach or the centrality of feminist, critical and postcolonial theory? Overall we felt there had been too little investigation of the kinds of modules which were actually being offered at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, or of the kinds of research and publications that members of the department were producing, including Fiona Darroch e not mentioned at all in the report e who at that time was and still is researching and teaching Caribbean literature and religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.10.016,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
390,Marginality and apostasy in the Baha'i community,"During most of Baha’i history, there have been both marginal and apostate Baha’is. This article is about a group of articulate and well-educated marginal and apostate Baha’is who first appeared in theWest about twenty-five years ago and who reached the peak of their activity in the last decade. The group's campaign against the Baha’i community brings to mind Max Scheler's description of the apostate as ‘engaged in a continuous chain of acts of revenge against his own spiritual past’. Following a terminological, methodological and ethical discussion, this article examines the phenomenon and makes six points. (1) These apostates seek to reverse the status of the Baha’i Faith from that of an ‘allegiant organisation’ to that of a ‘subversive’ one, or a ‘cult’. (2) The experiences of the apostates form a dark mirror image to those of the core members. (3) The Internet has been used extensively by these apostates to create a community of their own, thereby assisting the passage of many of them from marginality to apostasy. (4) This community has developed its own mythology, creed and salvation and has become what can perhaps be called an anti-religion. (5) Apostates have written papers and books that have been accepted by academic journals and presses. (6) If religious communities want to avoid facing attacks by apostates, it is necessary to act at an early stage of the process, as it is almost impossible to do anything later.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.008,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
391,Pilgrimage growth in the modern world: Meanings and implications,"This article examines the contemporary growth of pilgrimages. Examples are provided from variety of traditions and parts of the world, from Japan to Europe, with particular attention paid to the Shikoku and Santiago de Compostela pilgrimages that have experienced extensive growth in recent years. It also draws attention to the growing number of new pilgrimage sites that are not associated with any specific religious traditions or that have ‘New Age’ associations. While some of the factors accounting for this growth involve continuities from past eras, there are also specifically modern factors. Also considered in this article is how some modern pilgrims appear to repudiate organised religion even while visiting sites normally associated with established religious traditions. Rather than implying some form of religious revival, contemporary pilgrimage growth may, then, be seen as evidence of an increasing turn away from religion as an organised entity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.009,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
392,Religion and Spirituality in Lonely Planet's India,"For years, the authors of the best-selling guide to India, Lonely Planet, has shaped the perspectives of many travellers. This article considers how religion is constructed as a category and how it is made relevant to travellers. I argue that ‘religion’ comes in two versions, one pertaining to the Indian hosts and one to travellers. Religion is based on tradition, faith and historical institutions, whose members, rituals and sacred sites are of interest to travellers. Spirituality has to do with the personal development of travellers and is exclusively referred to as philosophy.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.07.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
393,Prologue: Negotiating women's roles and power: The practice of world religions in contemporary Asia,"The articles that comprise this special issue make a convincing case for the importance of anthropological research in the field of gender and religion. Based upon the work of a panel presented at the 2002 annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association, these articles demonstrate the anthropological facility for moving back and forth between ‘great traditions' and local conditions. In different ways and in different contexts, these articles point to a variable pattern of ancient, local or indigenous cosmological equality and women's ritual leadership that are effaced as a result of political or cultural conquest by a literate, centralised, male-dominated ‘great tradition’. Equally important, these articles demonstrate that this effacement is rarely complete. Rather, women's power is fluid, dynamic, variable and negotiated at varying institutional and interpretive levels. These tensions illustrate how analyses of gender in religion work with different sets of issues. The first set of issues centres on women, that is, on actual persons who have varying degrees of agency within specific social situations. The second set of issues centres on what is often called ‘Woman’, a symbolic construct that conflates gender, sex and sexuality that is composed of allegory, ideology, metaphor, fantasy and projection.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
394,"Becoming a nun, becoming a man: Taiwanese Buddhist nuns' gender transformation","This article explores apparent contradictions in the gender identifications of Taiwanese Buddhist nuns. Because the texts and teachings of their tradition provide conflicting messages about women's spiritual abilities, the nuns create a complex gender cosmology as a means of accommodating textual contradictions, without rejecting any textual statements. This strategy allows the nuns to assert that they have spiritual abilities equal to those of men, without rejecting or contradicting textual statements that they do not. Without denying that they are women, and that they are therefore threatening to men, the nuns primarily identify themselves with the male gender. Compartmentalising and contextualising gender symbols allow the nuns to see themselves both as men and as women without contradiction.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.005,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
395,Divine reconciliations: The Mother of Grain and Gautama Buddha in De'ang religion,"Located in China along the boarders of China and several Southeast Asian countries, Southwestern China is characterised by ethnic diversity and the influence of various world religions, especially that of different schools of Buddhism. This article examines how the De’ang people transform the cosmological order of Theravada Buddhism to reassert the indispensable position of their indigenous agricultural goddess, the Mother of Grain. Corresponding to myths that portray the reconciliation between the goddess and Gautama Buddha, the rituals dedicated to her are performed primarily by women, while male monastic institutions participate on certain ceremonial occasions. A comparison with similar beliefs and rituals in other cultural groups in the region demonstrates that the Mother of Grain in De’ang religion offers an exceptionally strong local challenge to the male bias embedded in Buddhism. By examining the conflicts and compromises between Buddhism and the indigenous religions of Southwest China, this article analyses the complex local negotiations of gender ideologies when world religions and local beliefs are at odds.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
396,Negotiating local tradition with Taoism: Female ritual specialists in the Zhuang religion,"The introduction of Taoism to many local religions in Southwest China was instrumental to the southern expansion of imperial China. Pivotal to the hierarchy of both the Taoist celestial imperium and traditional Han Chinese society, the ideology of male dominance has likewise prevailed over a large area of this region, although in varying forms and degrees. Meanwhile, indigenous people of the region have continually and creatively negotiated their own respective worldviews with Taoism, importantly including distinct gender ideals and practices. Using religious texts and ethnographic material, this article focuses on the ritual negotiation between opposing concepts of gender: one from the Chinese imperium, the male-privileging Chinese Taoist religion introduced from the north, the other locally situated in the women-empowering religion of the Zhuang people and of many other religions across Southwest China and Southeast Asia. This article focuses on the interactions between local ideals and world religions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
397,Defining ‘Modern’ Malay womanhood and the coexistent messages of the veil,"The gender constructions and performances of Malay women are often perceived by outside researchers as ‘shrouded under a veil’ of increasing Islamic conservatism. Urban Malay women, however, argue that women actively engage in the construction and performance of gender identities. Based on research conducted in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during 2001 and 2003, this article argues that women advantageously alter, transform and utilise the constructs placed upon them by Islam, by ethnic identification and by conceptions of ‘modernity’. Often one image of ‘womanhood’ is presented and in public e an image that is socially accepted, honoured and respected e while less publicly alternative forms of ‘womanhood’ articulate individual goals and aims. Using an agent-oriented perspective, this article further includes an analysis of women's individual renegotiations of larger cultural constructs and the ways in which the tudong, or headscarf, has become a symbol by which individual women express their understanding of social position and personal freedoms in an industrialised Islamic context.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.006,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37

The themes of purity, danger and fundamentalism; female leadership, mediumship, self-sexism; and natalism and nationalism are discussed.

399,The Frazerian roots of contemporary theories of religion and violence,"The association of religion with violence rather than with peace long antedates 9/11. Among theorists of religion, the association goes back at least to J.G. Frazer, author of the classic The Golden Bough (first ed. 1890). Contemporary theorists who tie religion to violence are beholden to Frazer, even when they spurn any dependence. At the same time the function of religious violence for contemporary theorists has shifted from control over the physical world to control over the social world. That shift typifies the overall shift from a nineteenth-century approach to religion to a twentieth-century one. This article considers two of the most prominent contemporary theorists who connect religion to violence: Rene Girard and Walter Burkert. How they at once depend on Frazer and break with him is the subject of this article.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.01.006,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
400,The danger of Durkheim: Ambiguity in the theory of social effervescence,"The purpose of this article is to shed light on an ambiguity in Émile Durkheim's theory of social effervescence. Durkheim's failure to distinguish two kinds of effervescence at the heart of the religious rite has left a dangerous legacy in the study of religion. If his work is read, however, in light of René Girard's theory of the violent origins of religion, his analysis of la société can retain the distinction between the effervescence of the crowd in scapegoating and the effervescence of protecting the victims of scapegoating. This thesis is tested by briefly comparing some contemporary essays on Durkheim.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.01.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
401,An ‘Oedipus pattern’ in the Old Testament?,"The Oedipus myth and a scapegoat pattern have been central issues in both Walter Burkert's and Rene Girard's writings about ancient Greek religion. This article proposes the existence of a comparable pattern in the Old Testament legend about the Ark (1e2 Samuel). Together with other Old Testament narratives (David, Moses) and other ancient Near Eastern legends and rituals, these instances form a transformational network, which shows some fundamental positions in a trans-cultural scapegoat-pattern of actantial positions: king, hero, villain and scapegoat.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.01.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
402,Twin phobia among the Haya of Northwestern Tanzania: Interpreting it within the mimetic theory,"This essay is an attempt to interpret the Haya twins' ceremonies according to the mimetic theory proposed by Rene Girard.1 It is divided into four parts. The first part is a presentation of the Haya and their cultural relationship to the larger Bantu group of the Great Lakes region of Eastern Africa. The second part is a resume of Girard's reflections on twin phobia and the general pattern of the ‘doubles’, which triggers the crisis of distinction in society and thereby the escalation of violence. The third part is a general survey of the phenomenon of twin phobia in Africa. Twins, though a threat, are treated as a blessing and are received with respect and gratitude. But some ethnic groups in Africa brutally eliminate twins for fear that they are a curse. In the fourth and fifth parts this essay describes how twins are received among the Haya. The essay concludes with an evaluation of what this phobia entails, using Girardian mimetic theory.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.01.008,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
403,Reconciling Nuers with Dinkas: A Girardian approach to conflict resolution,"In the Sudan in the 1990s, violent conflict between the Nuers and the Dinkas, both African tribes in the South of Sudan, included rape, murder, the burning of homes and the abduction of children. This conflict ended through the Wunlit People-to-People Peace Conference, organised in 1999 by the New Sudan Council of Churches, with the support of the Sudan People's Liberation Army. In this essay the conflict and its resolution are interpreted through Rene Girard's theory of the scapegoat mechanism. The essay offers a series of guidelines for successful reconciliation. At the centre of the proceedings was the religious sacrifice of the white bull of Mabior. The resolution of the conflict confirms Girard's theory of sacrificial violence. In the author's view, Girard's theory offers a model for transforming debilitating, imitative and violent behaviours into beneficial and positive ones.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2007.01.004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-37
404,Modernity and its imbalances: Constructing modern selfhood in the Mata Amritanandamayi Mission,"This article explores the orientations towards ‘modernity’ among devotees of the popular female guru in contemporary India, Mata Amritanandamayi. It examines the understanding of modernity popularised by this guru and shows how this understanding informs the world views and lifestyles of her Indian followers. These followers, most of them educated, middle-class urbanites, are exposed to modernity in their everyday lives. The understanding of modernity in the guru's fold leads devotees to idealise a form of selfhood that allows expression for their faith and emotions and that thereby facilitates the transcendence of the so-called ‘imbalances' of modern personalities and lifestyles. The realisation of this form of selfhood does not mean a rejection of modernity. Instead, it purportedly better equips followers to cope with the stresses of modernity. This article analyses the logic that underpins this view of modernity, and the different interpretations, within this guru's fold, of the modern West and of its relationship to India.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2006.09.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-36
405,Beyond Christendom: Protestant—Catholic distinctions in coming global Christianity,"Using actual and projected population data from the World Christian Database, this article evaluates Philip Jenkins' argument that the centre of global Christianity is moving from the Euro‐American centre (the ‘global North’) to the developing world (the ‘global South’) by disaggregating the different outcomes of this shift for Protestants and Catholics. Over the next fifty years, Catholics will decline much less than Protestants in the North, and will be concentrated in Latin America, not Africa. With the decline of the Enlightenment nation‐state, religious authority and identity will become more concentrated in Catholicism but will become more dispersed in Protestantism. This transition from national to global Christianity, I argue, will realign the post‐Reformation achievement of balanced tension among three social realitiesd Protestantism, Catholicism and the nation‐statedto produce not just another Christendom but a new, more complex articulation of civil and religious realities that will move beyond the old arrangement of Christendom altogether.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2006.09.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-36
406,A new Buddhist sect?: The Dhammakāya temple and the politics of religious difference,"In this article I explore the politics of the Dhammakāya temple controversy that captivated the Thai public in 1998 and 1999. By looking at the claim that the Dhammakāya temple constitutes a new nikāi, I examine a debate over tradition and innovation, a debate that has implications for modern constructions of sectarianism and of authentic Buddhism within the Thai sangha. I address the following questions: What kinds of innovations in doctrine and practice are acceptable? What constitutes a new nikāi in late modern Thailand? Who decides what is and is not consistent with orthodox Buddhism?",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2006.10.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-36
407,"Usama bin Ladin, the Qur'an and Jihad","Does Usama bin Ladin speak for all Muslims? Is he qualified to interpret the Qur’an? Does ‘jihad’ really mean ‘holy war’? Most Muslims answer ‘No!’ to all three questions, especially in the war of 9/11, but on what basis? Western mass media have in effect allowed bin Ladin to set the agenda by not examining the reasoning on all sides of the issue. This article analyses the Qur’anic basis for bin Ladin's arguments in two crucial pre-9/11 documents: his three-part Declaration of War of August 1996, and the ‘fatwa’ (legal opinion) of 23 February 1998, of which the formal title is The Statement of the World Islamic Front Urging Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders. It shows that, while bin Ladin does not use the commonly abused exegetical technique of abrogation, he also does not hesitate, whenever convenient, to ignore the authoritative sources that he often cites, to take Qur’anic verses or passages out of context, and to define key words in ways that seem to lend scriptural support to his extremism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2006.06.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-36
408,Astonishment: A study of an ethically valorised emotion in Buddhist narrative literature,"This essay explores the role that Buddhist narrative literature plays in fostering the cultivation of ethically valorised emotions. The essay focuses on astonishment, as it figures in Ārya Śūra's Jātakamālā, a collection of Sanskrit narratives. The essay examines how and why Ārya Śura valorises astonishment and what this valorisation reveals about the significance of emotions in Buddhist ethical life. The key distinction implicit in Ārya Śura's work between natural and cultivated emotions is worked out.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2006.07.004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-36
409,Religious studies in Scotland: A persistent tension with divinity,"This article treats the history of the study of religions in Scotland as a chapter in the history of the academic study of religions in the UK and Continental Europe. After sketching traditions of ‘Scottish comparative religion’ from the late nineteenth century to the interwar period, the authors map out an institutional history of ‘Religious Studies' as a distinctive disciplinary formation in Scotland since 1970. The emergence, consolidation and in some cases decline of this relatively new academic field are charted at the five main contemporary university sites in Scotland where religion, as a distinct subject, is taught: Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling and the Open University. In the cases of Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh, the authors argue that ‘Religious Studies' has had to fashion its niche in the context of the ecclesiastical authority enjoyed by Scottish Divinity faculties, resulting in an ongoing ‘tension’ between Religious Studies and Theology. The development of the subject at Stirling and the Open University underscores the historical alignment of Religious Studies with non-Presbyterian educational values in Scotland, whereas the persistence of Religious Studies in Schools of Divinity at the other Scottish universities may veil the traditionally ‘religionist’ stance of most scholars of religion working in these institutions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-36
410,Faqir or faker?: The Pakpattan tragedy and the politics of Sufism in Pakistan,"On the night of April 1, 2001, over a hundred devotees were crushed to death in a mob stampede during the annual pilgrimage at the shrine of Pakistan's most famous Sufi saint, Baba Farid ad-Din Ganj-i Shakkar. This article explores this tragedy as a case study of the politics of Sufism. In today's Pakistan, Sufism remains an emotive, multi-valent and highly contested symbolda lightning rod in the contestation over Islamic identity, authority and authenticity. While most Pakistanis view Sufi saints as the embodiment of Islamic virtued-true faqirs (‘impoverished ones’) committed to a life of piety, self-sacrifice and public servicedthe detractors of the tradition dismiss them as fakers. Faqir or faker? The opposing answers to this question reveal how the Sufi tradition is argued and debated in Pakistan and throughout the modern Muslim world. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, I examine the differing responses of the state, the shrine custodians and a group of Chishti Sabiri Sufi disciples to the Pakpattan tragedy of 2001. Focusing on the response of Sufi participants, I trace how a story of personal loss and national trauma was transformed into a narrative of sacrifice and sacralisation, with Sufism framed as Islamic orthodoxy.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2006.02.013,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-36
411,The Italian school of ‘history of religions’,"This study sets out to cast light on the most significant theoretical and methodological aspects of the Italian School of History of Religions, a school that owes its particular character to the cultural commitment of Raffaele Pettazzoni, Ernesto de Martino and Angelo Brelich. Since these scholars are not well known internationally, this article aims at providing some keys to their interpretation for the purpose of a wider circulation. The thought of Pettazzoni, de Martino and Brelich has not exhausted its potential and can make a far from negligible contribution to today's discussions on subjects such as the role of the history of religions in contemporary culture, the meaning of the secular approach to the religious phenomenon, and the search for new conceptions of the comparative method. The most pregnant image of the history of religions provided by an analysis of the works of these Italian scholars is that of a discipline committed to tackling the problems of our time.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2005.10.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-35
412,"Methodological concerns in the psychology of religion: Continuities, losses and transforming perspectives","This article seeks solutions to what has recently been called the ‘crisis' in the psychology of religion by returning to the programs of its founding fathers. It explores some of the methodological debates that followed the translation of William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience into German. More was at stake than the commonly drawn distinction between empirical and hermeneutical approaches to religion, or between quantitative and qualitative methods. What was at stake was the need for another kind of psychology in general. This article pays special attention to Wilhelm Wundt's fundamental criticism of James and of others in the psychology of religion. Despite the problems inherent in both James' and Wundt's aborted general psychology programs, each nonetheless contains approaches that may yet serve as an impetus to contemporary research on religion. Contemporary developments in cultural psychology in particular complement current research in the psychology of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2005.07.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-35

414,Militant protestantism: An analysis of the theology of political resistance and its impact on Northern Ireland,"Ian Paisley is a controversial figure in the politics of Northern Ireland. Throughout the Troubles, and even before, he has led protests in opposition to religious and political developments in the province. He has also been associated with organisations that claimed to be ready to defend Ulster if the British Government's security policy collapsed. These organisations were prepared to use force if necessary. Paisley has been very vocal in his criticism of the British Government as well as other bodies of State. But Paisley claims to be a fundamentalist Christian and considers his comments and actions to be in conformity with his religious convictions. This article explores the theological and historical foundations of Paisley's thinking and endeavours to account for the political theology of Protestant fundamentalists like Paisley.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2005.05.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-35
415,Western esotericism: Towards an integrative model of interpretation,"Despite the fact that during the last fifteen years we have witnessed the emergence of a research field of ‘Western esotericism’, scholars are still far from agreeing on definitions of ‘esotericism’. For an academic ‘field’, however, that wants to establish international networks and to bring together scholars from various research areas and disciplines, it is highly desirable to provide an interpretational framework in which these different studies find their place. The main argument of this article is that such common ground can be found only when esotericism is seen not as a selection of historical ‘currents’, however defined, but as a structural element of Western culture. After reviewing the most influential approaches to Western esotericism, this article identifies two dimensions of an esoteric discourse: claims of higher knowledge and ways of accessing this ‘truth’. To these dimensions can be added certain world views that are typically involved in there discourses. The interpretative model proposed here aims at critically addressing basic aspects of Western self-understanding including the rhetorics of rationality, science, enlightenment, progress and absolute truth. It postulates that conflicts of religious world views, identities and forms of knowledge lie at the heart of Western cultural history.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2005.07.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-35
416,Reconceptualising the human body: Heaven's Gate and the quest for divine transformation,"The mass suicide of the members of Heaven's Gate in 1997 stimulated much debate about the causes of so extreme an end to a new religious movement. Using primary source materials in conjunction with existing research, I present in this article an in-depth analysis of both the belief system and the behaviours of the members of the group. By using the sociology of the body and a psychobiography of the group leader, Marshall Applewhite, I show how ideas about the human body derived from individual psychopathology were translated into group belief and action. I argue that the relationship among these variables created the circumstances that led thirty-nine persons to believe that they were leaving this planet for a better existence in a parallel dimension.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2005.06.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-35
417,The Al Qaeda 9/11 instructions: A study in the construction of religious martyrdom,"A growing global concern about suicide attacks has led to attempts from various disciplines to understand the psychological profiles of persons willing to commit suicide terrorist attacks. Recent reports have suggested that more powerful explanatory models might be discovered using social psychological concepts, with a shift of focus from the individual to the group within which the individual acts and by which the individual is influenced. This paper attempts to do so by presenting an analysis of the Al Qaeda ‘final instructions’ document, which sheds light on the way members of this group were mobilised towards conducting one of the most devastating assaults in modern history. We discuss the use of religious doctrine and rhetorical devices as a psychological strategy employed by this group to inspire, control and mobilise its members before and during the September 11, 2001, attacks.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2005.02.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-35
418,Numbers in Nirvana: How the 1872–1921 Indian censuses helped operationalise ‘Hinduism’,"A debate has recently re-emerged about whether Hinduism in India is a colonial invention or antedates European colonialism. Drawing on the Indian censuses of 1872-1921, I argue that Hinduism is both. It has complex linkages both to European colonialism and to indigenous Indian culture. Traditions like Hinduism are better conceived of as a negotiated territory between factions instead of solely being the creation of one dominant group.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2005.02.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-35
419,Religion and Mestrovic's postemotional society: The manufacturing of religious emotion,"Work on the social theory of emotion has been growing in the last decade, but few have considered how these studies relate to the field of religion. This article is a detailed critical examination of the work of the Croatian‐American sociologist Stjepan Mestrovic and his idea of ‘postemotionalism’. It is an exploration of the implications of his work for understanding contemporary manifestations of religion. It first unfolds the context of Mestrovic's work on postemotionalism and then explores the development and meaning of the term. It follows a series of tensions in the concept between spontaneous and produced emotion and seeks to show how postemotionalism fails to consider adequately religious history, which has continually involved the process of repackaging ‘past emotions’. Despite these difficulties, Mestrovic's idea of postemotionalism is seen to provide not only a way to rethink emotion and rationality in religion, but a way of re-conceptualising so-called ‘individual’ religious emotion as part of wider political constructions developed through late capitalistic markets and the technology of mass media. Mestrovic's lack of concern with religion is considered, and the work of the French sociologist of religion Danie` le Hervieu-Le ger on ‘chain memory’ is introduced as a way of illuminating questions of religious tradition, memory and emotion in Mestrovic's work. The final section of the paper considers the ‘revivalist’ developments of Celtic Spirituality as an example of the micro-politics of postemotional religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2004.09.007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
420,Constructionism versus what?,"Constructionism is a theoretical perspective with great potential usefulness for the study of religion. However, the theory is often assumed rather than clarified, and it is often reduced to its extreme relativistic versions. As a result, its value has stagnated even as talk of constructs has proliferated. Constructionism has been portrayed as the other of religion's two realisms: theological and phenomenological. It has been cast in the role of a conveniently discounted counter-position. Constructionist work in the study of religion, by failing to clarify its theoretical basis adequately and by too often accepting the role of antagonist to realism, shares responsibility for this misleading and detrimental characterisation. Lack of due attention to theory has obscured the status and claims of constructionism. This theoretical perspective is not necessarily reductionist or radically relativist, and it is not simply the opposite of realist or sui generis approaches to religion. Constructionism can help us understand how historically and culturally contingent religious phenomena arise from the raw materials of our physical and social worlds.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2004.09.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
421,"Three generations of post-war study of Judaism in Germany: Goldberg, Schaefer, Houtman and Becker and the demolition of historical Judaism","German academic anti-Judaism—theological contempt for the religion set forth out of Scripture by the Rabbinic sages of antiquity—begins with Martin Luther and survives the Third Reich. That is shown by the nihilistic representation of Rabbinic Judaism in post World-War II German scholarship, which denies to Judaism a determinate textual corpus, a synchronic venue, a diachronic context. Three generations—Arnold M. Goldberg, his disciple, Peter Schaefer, and Schaefer's disciples, Alberdina Houtman and Hans-Juergen Becker—have systematically denied to Judaism the possibility of historical study as a culture in dialogue with a particular social order. The outcome of the German academic tradition is a religion without determinate texts, religious texts out of all context—and texts without contents: the nullification of Judaism as a fact of history and culture.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2004.09.010,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
422,Marketing the goods of salvation: Bourdieu on religion,"Pierre Bourdieu's work has had a resounding impact on disciplines ranging from linguistics to anthropology to art history to literary criticism. Scholars of religion have, however, been relatively slow to catch on to the theoretical gold mine that academics in other fields have discovered in Bourdieu's work, doubtless in part because Bourdieu himself pays only limited attention to religion. The present article is intended to serve as an introduction to Bourdieu's theory of practice as it applies to his sociological theory of religion, which is especially serviceable for the analysis of the relationship among religion, class and power. Haitian religion and culture are used as a case study in the spirit of Bourdieu's own insistence that theory always be confronted with the substantive and never be exercised in a vacuum.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2004.09.008,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
423,Graveyards: Russian ritual and belief pertaining to the dead,"The age-old tradition of feasting the dead has been maintained by Russian populations for well over five centuries. Graveyards hold a special place both in traditional Orthodox faith and in the lives of Russians and others in the city of Narva, Estonia. The tradition of feasting the dead for three, nine and forty days after death, can be traced unbroken to pre-Christian Rus’. Details may vary, but always the soul of the deceased must battle its way out of the body and then spend time in both heaven and hell. While this journey is occurring, the living must remember the dead, helping their souls during this period of travail. Even a final feast one year after the death of the individual does not end the relationship between the living and the deceased, for the graves are still visited on a regular basis as a sign of respect to the dead, who are potential saints in the Russian Orthodox tradition. This ‘saintly’ land — Russian graves — defines homeland and roots the population to a new area. By examining the importance of graveyards to Russians, to the ethnic Komi of Northern Russia, and other Eastern Europeans, I demonstrate that a sense of place is maintained in these rituals of daily life.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2004.09.009,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
424,Alien demonology: The Christian roots of the malevolent extraterrestrial in UFO religions and abduction spiritualities,"Initially, the sacralisation of the extraterrestrial led to an understanding of the alien as a fundamentally benevolent, messianic figure—a ‘technological angel’. This was largely because of the Cold War environment in which much UFO religion arose. Those attracted to the myth looked beyond a politically and militarily unstable planet to extraterrestrial saviours. Furthermore, because UFO religions have their roots in the Theosophical tradition, the religious understanding of the extraterrestrial tended to be fundamentally indebted to the concept of the wise and benevolent ascended master. The aim of this article is to examine the technological angel's foil. The central thesis is that, in their construction of the malevolent alien, UFO religionists and abductees turn not to Theosophy and Eastern religious traditions but to the myths and symbols of Christian demonology. Moreover, in exploring the origins and nature of the demonologies of contemporary UFO religions and abduction spiritualities, the article also draws attention to the importance of popular culture in the West, which, itself influenced by the Christian tradition, contributes to the formation of both popular demonology and also UFO mythology, which are in turn synthesised in UFO demonologies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2004.04.014,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
425,Monkey kings make havoc: Iconoclasm and murder in the Chinese cultural revolution,"This article explores the interplay between destruction of material icons and people during China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), when authority figures—teachers, landlords, monks and nuns, bosses, intellectuals, doctors, Party leaders—were ‘struggled against’ by gangs of teenage revolutionaries called Red Guards. There is striking continuity in the rhetoric and the symbolic practices of the Red Guards as they destroyed statues and to a lesser extent, signs, buildings, and books, and as they killed people. Through techniques of demonisation—the affixing of negative iconic values—the rhetoric of destruction moved all too easily from image to body and from body to image. Yet just as iconoclasm is not always the utter annihilation of an iconic object but, more crucially, an attack on its iconicity, the violence against living people which tends to accompany iconoclastic movements often seems to be about stripping away the external signs of identity and then redefining the boundaries between categories of bodies. After a brief survey of four phases of Communist iconoclasm in China, I explore a number of aspects of Chinese iconoclasm which blur the distinctions between icons and bodies, related to conceptions of icons as living, the production of iconic bodies, and the ‘iconoclasm of the habitus.’ These themes are explored in commentary on two products of Cultural Revolution iconoclasm: Born Red, a memoir by Gao Yuan, and Qiao Dianyun's short story ‘The Blank Stele.’",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2004.01.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
426,"Orientalism, representation and religion: The reality behind the myth","Said's Orientalism has been called an ‘epoch-making’ and ‘paradigm constitutive’ book. While it undoubtedly caused a stir on its appearance and proved an important influence upon post-colonial studies and other developments in literary and cultural theory, a careful re-reading of it reveals a deeply flawed work that offers a confused analysis of human representations and realities, a highly selective and partial engagement with Western and Middle Eastern history and scholarship, and a particularly unhelpful approach to religion. The argument offered here is that Said's claims about ‘Orientalism’ are actually incoherent, veering between Foucauldian social constructionism and references to trans-cultural human realities; that the theoretical approaches to religion are inconsistent and highly selective; that the account of human agency is entirely inadequate; and that, although Said condemns entire generations of Orientalist scholars as racist, imperialist and ethnocentric, he is insufficiently reflective about his own scholarly position and the implications of its inconsistencies. Although Orientalism has been hailed as a book that ‘breathed insurgency’, it actually offers a vision of human beings as remarkably powerless in the face of arbitrary and abstract discourses that define their lives as oppressors or oppressed. Said sought to demonstrate that the reality behind the myth of scholarly impartiality was a racist and ethnocentric exercise of control and authority over the Orient, but the reality behind the myth of Orientalism is a theoretically flawed work offering a reductive account of religion and an impoverished view of human beings.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2003.12.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
427,"Representation and its discontents: Orientalism, Islam and the Palestinian crisis"," Orientalism has become the pivotal account of the relationship between Europe and its others. But its very focused and selective account of Orientalism has provoked controversy from all sides. Said's work must be seen as an argument rather than as the presentation of some transcendental historical truth because we may then see that it fulfils a much broader task set for the ‘Oriental’: to take back the power of representation from the dominant culture. Orientalism remains even more critical now than twenty-five years ago because the task of taking hold of self-representation has become, for Palestinians, a matter of life and death. Resistance (muqãwamah) was first applied to literature by the Palestinian writer and critic Ghassan Kanafani, and the example of post-colonial literature remains the crucial model for the Palestinian people. This article proposes that the post-colonial strategy of transformation turns resistance from a simple opposition to a control of the means of representation. Success for the Palestinian people will never come from armed struggle but from the control of representation and the communication of the Palestinian situation to a dominant audience. In this way the achievement of Orientalism can be extended to the level of contemporary politics.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2003.12.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
428,Upstart theories and early American religiosity: A reassessment,"Attempts to assess the theory of religious economies developed by Rodney Stark and his associates have generated an enormous secondary literature. For Stark himself, one beneficial effect has been a new paradigm in the study of religion that gives more emphasis to the social than to the psychological. A case is made here that key assertions in the theory have been falsified, that disconfirming evidence has been ‘explained away’ rather than explained and that the theory actually diverts attention from areas that might benefit from sociological scrutiny. But if all this is so, then why does that theory continue to command so much attention? Part of the answer is that the theory is perceived to work so well in particular contexts, and the context mentioned most often is early American religion. For that reason, the bulk of this article is concerned with taking a careful second look at Finke and Stark's The Churching of America. The evidence presented in that work turns out to be far less supportive of their general theory than is generally acknowledged. The final section of this article identifies some implicit ideological themes in the theorising by Stark et al. that likely account for its continuing popularity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2003.07.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
429,Dreams of passage: An object-relational perspective on a case of a Hindu death ritual,"By examining the case of a death ritual in a Surinam-Hindu community in the Netherlands, the authors want to demonstrate the usefulness of object-relations theory in the study of religion. Because it focuses on the dynamic interaction between individual and culture, this psychological theory embraces a truly cultural-psychological approach. D.W. Winnicott's idea of ‘transitional phenomena’ is central in this respect. Cultural activities, such as participating in rituals and myths, are said to have a transitional function, when they sustain identity formation and coping with crises. Based on Arnold van Gennep's famous term ‘rites of passage’ as well as on the psychoanalyst Geza Róheim's insights into rites and myths of passage, the new term rêve de passage (dream of passage) is coined. Dreams may also have a transitional function in situations of crisis and change. As an example, we discuss the dream of one of the mourners in the case discussed. By using cultural meanings from her social and religious context—in particular, the notion of the mahapatra—the dream helps the mourner to cope with a difficult situation and to make the transition back to ordinary life. The article concludes that the concept of rêve de passage, as developed within the object-relational framework, is a promising tool for dream research in both religious studies and anthropology.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2003.11.002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-34
430,Reading the Halakhah as a religious statement: Part One,"The letter forms the medium for the spirit, so the letter of the law of the Torah here stands forth as the embodiment of the religion of the law of the Torah. The Halakhah, or law, focuses on the interiority of holy Israel's life; the Aggadah, or lore, on the exteriority of Israel's relationships. How exactly the Halakhah is to be read as a religious statement is spelled out in this article. But what about Israel within? I maintain that the Halakhah embodies the extension of God's design for world order into the inner-facing relationships of [1] God and Israel, [2] Israel's inner order in its own terms, and [3] the Israelite's household viewed on its own in time and space and social circumstance. If we wish to explore the interiority of Israel in relationship with God, as a shared order, and of Israel's autonomous building block, the household, we are required to take up the norms of everyday conduct that define Israel and signify its sanctification. We commence by examining the data that reveal the governing category-formation: how precisely the Halakhah organises and systematises the Torah's facts and rules of ordinary life.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2003.09.004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33
431,To control death: Sacrifice and space in classical Greece,"Why was death considered polluting within classical Greek society when Olympian sacrifice was ubiquitous? Outside the polis the Greeks’ view of the uncultivated or improperly cultivated geography and of their own ‘city-less’ past was just the other way around. Here death represented no pollution whatsoever, while Olympian sacrifice was either absent or not properly performed. Death and life had yet to be separated, as had happened in the proper human realm of the Greek polis. Any reintroduction of either natural death or sacrifice into the ‘city of life’ would consequently negate its very structures. Sacrifice differed exactly through the aspect of control. Acts of sacrifice were therefore used to control the onset of natural death. But why would the Greeks sacrifice also in every other possible context? As the essential human characteristic, mortality pertained to all human creations, including the polis. Left to itself, the polis would wither and die. Through Olympian sacrifice, humans dissolved the structures of the city without ever losing control, thereby introducing the unlimited potential as still found in the primordial state of the uncultivated geography. The structures of the polis were recreated through the proper division of the sacrificial victim.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2003.09.003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33
432,Counterintuitiveness as the hallmark of religiosity,"This article presents empirical evidence for the hypothesis that persons consider counterintuitive representations more likely to be religious than other kinds of beliefs. In three studies the subjects were asked to rate the probable religiousness of various kinds of imaginary beliefs. The results show that counterintuitive representations in general, and counterintuitive representations involving a conscious agent in particular, are considered much more likely to be religious. Counterintuitiveness thus seems to be an important element in a folk-understanding of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.religion.2003.09.001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33
433,How magic survived the disenchantment of the world,"This article argues that the process described by Max Weber as the ‘disenchantment of the world’ is compatible with the continued vitality of ‘the occult’ in contemporary western culture. Focusing on the example of ‘hermetic’ magical traditions in western culture before and after the pivotal period of the Enlightenment, the article analyses the relation between continuity and change in the development of these traditions from three angles: their theories of magical efficacy, the nature of their practices and the ways in which magicians seek to legitimate magic to the wider society as well as to themselves. The discussion demonstrates that the transformation of magic under the impact of modernization and secularization resulted in the paradoxical phenomenon of a ‘disenchanted magic’. The article concludes by proposing a theory that explains why it is actually quite natural for magic to have survived the disenchantment of the world.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2803%2900053-8,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33
434,The Allegory of the Olive Tree: A case study for (neo) structuralist analysis,"The Book of Mormon presents a fascinating opportunity to test aspects of structuralist analysis of myth and culture. This article examines some of the key issues in structuralist theory and attempts to develop some new avenues of structuralist analysis, particularly in relation to agency and transformation. Although in some sense these avenues can be seen as challenging principles of traditional structuralism, the changes suggested are more refinements than significant alterations. The article then tests these theories in relation to a series of very complex allegories in the Book of Mormon. This discussion both demonstrates the analytical power of the approach and raises some interesting ethnographic issues, particularly the presence of triadic rather than dyadic structure. In order to add a diachronic aspect to the discussion and to examine process of transformation between cultures, the article touches on the use of similar allegories in the New Testament and in Intertestamental literature.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2803%2900045-9,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33
435,Disrobing judges with veiled truths: An early Ismā‘īlī Torah interpretation (ta'wīl) in service of the Fātimid mission,"It has long been known that in the tenth century, missionaries for a Shī‘ite Islamic sect known as the Ismā‘īlīs interpreted stories from the Torah and Gospels. The prevailing theory holds that the Ismā‘īlīs composed extra-Qur’ānic ta'wīl (allegorical interpretation) to proselytise Jews and Christians. A close analysis of a ta'wīl of the biblical story of Judah and Tamar by the missionary Ja‘far ibn Mantūr al-Yaman (d. ca. 960) suggests, however, that when early Ismā‘īlī authors interpreted Torah, they did so for a Muslim audience within an Islamic polemical milieu.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2803%2900033-2,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33
436,Epidemiology and the study of religion,"In recent decades epidemiologists have increasingly investigated the relationships between religion and health. Although not directed at religion in itself, these efforts are instructive for how religion might be insightfully studied. This essay will identify three problematic topics in contemporary religious studies and indicate how recent epidemiological research regarding religion contributes to their insightful treatment. One topic concerns the roles of social identity—e.g., gender, race and class—in the study of religion; a second concerns religious pluralism as a descriptive and evaluative concept; and the third involves the conceptual vagueness of much religious discourse. A final section of the paper will argue that the statistical approach of epidemiology and the interpretive practices of religious studies are methodologically distinct but not categorically different. Data analysis and textual exegesis are both hermeneutic undertakings sharing several problems and prospects.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2803%2900015-0,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33
437,Sacred texts,"It seems indisputable that the way we define and classify texts influences the way we read texts. My concern is to develop methods for reading and understanding texts that are influenced by distinctions between the secular and the sacred, and then draw out some preliminary implications of these methods and distinctions for relationships between church and state in liberal democracies. Distinctions between sacred and secular texts can be tracked with the conjecture that a full textual reading of a sacred text requires a kind of interior commitment. I develop the conjecture, and then argue that this requirement increases the distance between scepticism and religious belief. The upshot of such distinctions and implications is that we cannot read sacred texts as sacred while maintaining the secular consciousness that defines liberal democracies. Acknowledging these textual differences between religion and politics lays to rest, permanently, the popular creed of exceptionalism, the belief that secular patterns of thought, grounded in compromise and toleration, can scan and comprehend religious beliefs from some impartial perspective.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2802%2900061-1,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33
438,The contemporary lay meditation movement and lay gurus in Sri Lanka,"This article examines the lay meditation movement occurring in contemporary Buddhism in Sri Lanka. The lay meditation movement represents a different perspective from the nationalistic Sinhala Buddhism that has dominated the discourse in the wake of the intractable ethnic conflict in the country. The lay meditation movement reflects the contemporary ferment in Buddhist discourse among the laity. One of the key themes in this movement is the privileging of experience because it gives the lay groups authority to challenge contemporary orthodoxy and it has empowered a new class of spiritual leaders, the lay gurus. Paraphrasing Stirrat, we can say that these lay gurus are leading the lay meditation movement towards ‘a series of different interpretations of what it means’ to be a Buddhist today. In its overall effect the lay meditation movement not only reconstructs what it means to be a Buddhist today but also points in the direction of establishing new forms of sectarianism that could be considered to be ‘new religious movements’ under the umbrella of Buddhism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2802%2900077-5,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33

Numerous scholars in the field of religion base their arguments about the modern rise of Buddhist revivalism and fundamentalism on ethnographic data from Sri Lanka's long tradition of Theravāda Buddhism. This article, based on fieldwork in Colombo during summer 2002, serves to update previous knowledge on Sri Lankan Buddhism by reporting on newer developments in this religious tradition. I argue that many of the recent trends in Sri Lankan Buddhism are linked in part to broader political and economic realities observed in the island today.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2802%2900078-7,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-33

441,Religious Discourse and Cyberspace,"This article explores the evolution and development of a typology of cyberspatial religious discourse over the course of a few years. The vast quantity of information published on the Net requires the creation of a typology in order to identify and classify the different approaches, attitudes, applications and functions of religion on and in cyberspace. The three different typologies indicate, on the one hand, the versatile character of cyberspace, and on the other hand, the ever-expanding nature of its perimeters. They show that cyberspatial discourse, religious or not, cannot be confined within restricted boundaries but must be perceived as a changeable and unforeseen structure, having the capacity to adapt itself according to the visions, fantasies, ingenuities and inventiveness of the users. They also suggest that despite the rhizomatic construction of cyberspace, the information published on the innumerable religious sites can be systematised in a ‘logical’ formation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0405,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32
442,Surfing for Salvation,"I demonstrate that despite the enormous amount of religion on the Internet, a general classification can be developed based upon the religious participation occurring at the various websites. I recognise these classifications as ‘religion-online’ and ‘online-religion’. Religion-online presents information about religion. It is a controlled environment. The site has been structured to limit participation. In contrast, online-religion provides an interactive religious environment for the web practitioner. Because of this difference, individuals and organisations have different perceptions concerning how the Internet should be used for religious purposes. In many cases there is an active form of religious participation occurring. Rituals are conducted, prayers are posted and even communion is carried out on this medium. In other situations the Internet presents material concerning religion to a passively receptive audience. Despite these levels of control, the web surfer is exposed to an enormous number of belief systems and also varying levels of online religious participation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0406,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32

444,Virtual Pilgrimages on the Internet,"Virtual pilgrimage on the Internet is an important religious phenomenon for understanding the new ways of being spiritual in the postmodern world. While often conservative in character, linked as they are to actual sacred sites that are permeated by the mythical imaginare of tradition, virtual pilgrimages exploit the new technological possibilities of the Internet to re-imagine the sacred. In what follows, I argue that virtual pilgrimage has four key characteristics as a form of religious travel. First, it creates a mythscape, an immaterial mental geography that originally comes from sacred oral or scriptural traditions. Second, it exists as an interactive visual-auditory medium for experiencing a sense of sacred presence. Third, it generates symbolic forms of entertainment that are liminoid in character. Fourth, as a leisure activity of individuals ‘Net surfing’ from their home or office computers, it can create ‘virtual travelling communities’ of pilgrims who use the discourse of communitas to describe their experience.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0408,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32
445,Determining the Place of Religion: Native American Traditions and the WWW,"Examples of Native American websites reveal great differences in those created by Native and non-Native people. Most often of central concern for non-Indian people is Native American ‘spirituality’. In contrast, Native people rarely discuss religion as a topic distinct from political, economic or material concerns. This disparity highlights the contentious nature of ‘religion’ between Indigenous and Immigrant cultural contexts. It also reveals some features of the relationships between the cultural phenomenon of ‘whiteness’ and religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0409,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32
446,Virtual Religion in Context,"This article explores the notion of ‘virtual religion’ in various ways. In part, it is a response to a number of ideas found in the articles by Philip P. Arnold, Shawn Arthur, Christopher Helland, Anastasia Karaflogka and Mark MacWilliams which appear in this issue of Religion, but it also discusses religion in online contexts in relation to various important themes such as the character of cyberspace both present and future, the multimedia Web and its alleged postmodern orientations, virtual identity, the dynamics of virtual community, and the controversies concerning the positive and negative ramifications of online life and experience, as discussed by technomystics, technophobes and others who hold more moderate views.

447,"Tradition, Authority and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act","The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was passed into law in 1990 and since that time has been implemented in ways that merit attention from scholars of religion. This article explores the legislative history of the law, analysing Native American appeals to ‘tradition’ in their quest to establish authority over disputed human and cultural remains. After a preliminary theoretical section that sets out relevant issues and questions, the essay engages a close reading of pivotal legislative hearings and reports, with attention to uses of religious and moral language. Building upon this reading, a dual analysis of Native American ‘traditional’ rhetoric is developed that examines the persuasive features of minority-specific claims, majority-inclusive claims and the combined force of these. Next, this line of analysis is framed in comparative and historical terms through a consideration of ‘revitalisation movements’. In light of this comparison, a case is made for interpreting NAGPRA and related movements as a primary means by which Native Americans manage their relationship to modernity, acting as critical citizens who demand their rights as Indians, Americans and human beings. The essay concludes by arguing for an understanding of social and discursive boundaries that neither limits nor is limited by ‘tradition’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0426,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32
448,The Science of Religions in a Fascist State: Rudolf Otto and Jakob Wilhelm Hauer During the Third Reich,"The German science of religions of the early twentieth century grew from the seeds of German idealism and Romanticism: anti-rationalism, anti-materialism, vitalism, experientialism, and ardent nationalism. In many accounts, National Socialism grew from these seeds, too. This essay examines the actual relationship between the science of religions and Nazism by examining the two most prominent German scientists of religions during the period, Rudolf Otto and Jakob Wilhelm Hauer. In important aspects Otto and Hauer pursued the same religio-scientific programs, but they realised it differently and so exemplify two different relationships between the science of religions and the National Socialist state.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0401,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32

Postcolonial criticism is used to analyse pilgrimage texts of the holy land (the Bordeaux pilgrim, Egeria, the Piacenza pilgrim) in order to explore various modes of constructing imperial Christian identity through use of the ‘figural Jew’ of ancient Palestine.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0398,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32
450,Why Malcolm X Never Developed an Islamic Approach to Civil Rights,"No student of Malcolm X's life has explored adequately the effects of Malcolm's relationships with foreign and immigrant Muslims on his approach to civil rights. This article argues that toward the end of his life Malcolm X accepted the Islamic ideology of his Arab Muslim sponsors, and in so doing, limited his own ability to conceptualise an Islam that was politically relevant to the struggle for black liberation. Embracing the idea that Islam was a universalistic tradition that, by definition, could have nothing to do with particularistic movements or struggles, the leader championed a pan-Africanist politics that sought to bring blacks together based on their common cultural and biological traits.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0400,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32
451,The Easternisation Thesis: Critical Reflections,"The influence of Eastern religions upon the West is often portrayed as a phenomenon of growing significance marking a watershed in contemporary religious and spiritual culture. In the most radical version of the Easternisation thesis, articulated most systematically by Colin Campbell, indigenous developments within Western culture point to the demise of the traditional dualistic religious conception of divinity as personal, transcendental and beyond worldly reality and its replacement with a monistic conception characterised by impersonality and immanence. This article subjects this thesis to critical examination and finds it deficient is four major respects. Firstly, it tends to stereotype Eastern religions in a somewhat misleading way. Secondly, it is insensitive to the marked differences between various Eastern religious traditions. Thirdly, it characterises those trends in Western culture which it sees as constituting Easternisation too readily and unequivocally as specifically religious developments. Fourthly, it ignores or glosses over the very this-worldly and therefore quintessentially Western character of these trends. The article concludes with an attempt to rescue some the insights of the Easternisation thesis by incorporating them into a broader framework and by offering some alternative suggestions for understanding the developments with which the thesis is concerned.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0429,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32

This paper suggests that such forms of repetition, and particularly ‘exhaustion,’ or the enumeration of an entire paradigm class, may naturalise or, in Saussure's term, ‘relatively motivate’ rituals and diminish the appearance of their arbitrariness. Ordeals and other rituals may respond to situations of uncertainty by using rhetorical devices to promote confidence in their outcomes. This contribution of poetic form to the pragmatic function of ritual is neglected in J. L. Austin's influential theory of ‘performative utterances.’",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0399,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32

Now for the first time in the annals of the German university a Protestant professor faces such an action by a church body. Professor Gerd Lüdemann, who since 1983 has taught New Testament Studies in the University of Göttingen, has become the target of criticism by the Confederation of Lutheran Churches in Lower Saxony. As a result of a decision by the President of his University, theology students can no longer receive credit for attending his courses, nor can he serve as director or advisor of graduate studies.

454,How to Prove Divinities? Experiencing and Defending Divine Agency in a Modern Indian Space,"Exploring material collected in the Hindu Temples of the Indian state capital Bhopal, this article deals with the problem of how to accommodate the divine in the modern world. It explores how the presence of the divine—in the form of revelations, miracles, mediums and prophets—is accommodated in the contemporary discourse of urban India. I show that the communication with deities is understood in terms of ‘sensory experience’ and ‘physical experimentation’ and is thus constructed in a way parallel to arguments in a ‘scientific’ discourse. As point of entry I have chosen the life history of Mr Bagware, a bank employee and a temple president in Bhopal, in order to show how he allowed the goddess to take over his life. This example is followed by a more general discussion of the ways the divine is experienced and the reasoning that allows for the integration of revelations, miracles, possession and predictions into the discourse of modernity. There follows a discussion of the different formulations of modernity and tradition and of the conflicting ways in which religion is accommodated within this framework.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0394,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32

While membership of Korean Christianity has grown explosively since this time, the growth rate began to decline from the mid 1980s onwards. It will be shown that the decline in the growth rate has, however, been different in Protestantism and Catholicism over the same period. The article looks at the different responses of both Protestantism and Catholicism to the process of rapid social and cultural change, and how these responses have influenced both membership growth and decline. In particular, it is argued that globalised postmodern culture has deeply influenced the recent membership crisis in Korean Christianity. The paper will close by summarising the contrasting Christian responses and predicting the future of Korean Christianity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0396,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32
457,Do Moving Ministers Move Congregations? Rational Choice Theory and Methodist Ministerial Itinerancy,"Ministerial itinerancy is characteristic of, although not exclusive to, the British Methodist Church. Rational choice theorists Finke and Starke have claimed that, historically, itinerancy has served to promote and reinforce instrumental commitment to the local church. This article develops and assesses a rational choice analysis of the effects of ministerial itinerancy on the organisational commitment of Methodist congregations and their ministers. It concludes that rational choice theory can only offer a partial analysis and fails to take into account less instrumental forms of organisational commitment. The article surveys the current debate within the Methodist Church about the future of ministerial itinerancy and suggests that the Church may be in the process of recognising that ‘moving ministers’ is not necessarily good at ‘moving congregations’ to embrace the national Church's priorities. The article predicts that itinerancy will remain an important feature, but not a defining characteristic, of the Methodist ministry and will no longer tend to ‘go with the job’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2002.0397,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32
458,Religion Within the Limits of History: Schleiermacher and Religion—A Reappraisal,"This article addresses the often overlooked but acute historical sense behind the theory of human religiousness presented in Friedrich Schleiermacher's influential On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers, and highlights its significance for the contemporary discussion regarding the study of religion. Defining religion as a unique and substantive dimension in human experience does not necessarily entail doing violence to historical difference. For Schleiermacher, the religious disposition is dialectically woven into the fabric of historical life, language being its communal medium. Religion never occurs by itself in some pure form but always already exists modified and actualised by cultural-linguistic ways of being in the world. Hence genuine religious plurality is not reducible to some abstract, ahistorical core but rather is confirmed and accounted for by means of an anthropological condition of possibility which renders it intelligible. Schleiermacher's so-called ‘subjective turn’ opens out ineluctably towards history, substantiating the complex conditionings of historical life rather than ignoring them, as critics of this approach often assume. The article explores the implications of this position as a model for religious studies and argues for a modified version of its basic thrust in light of several postmodern concerns.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2001.0319,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-32

His influence led a few of his compatriots to follow in his footsteps during the dark decades of Communism, but not until the overthrow of the Ceauşescu Government in 1989 did it again become possible to engage freely in HR studies.

This article examines in great detail the involvement of the evangelical Protestant religious and political leader Reverend Ian Paisley in the political violence of Northern Ireland. It concludes that, despite the context apparently encouraging a Protestant jihad, or holy war, Ulster evangelicals are peaceful and law-abiding. Parallels with American fundamentalism are used to raise the question of contrasts to Islamic fundamentalism. It is argued that fundamentalisms differ in their attitudes towards political violence and that the differences are unlikely to be just a matter of circumstance.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2001.0357,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
461,Unity and Plurality: Hinduism and the Religions of India in Early European Scholarship,"A body of recent scholarship assumes that because European writers were constrained by a certain notion of what a religion is, they imposed an artificial conceptual unity on the diverse religions they encountered in India. But during the earlier phases of European contact with India, ‘religion’ had not yet fully undergone the process of reification first analysed by Wilfred Cantwell Smith. A study of descriptions of Indian religions from the sixteenth to the early eighteenth century in the works of Roberto Nobili, Henry Lord, Abraham Roger and Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg demonstrates that there was no simple and straightforward imposition of unity on these religions. The term ‘religion’ was used, along with others such as ‘sect’ and ‘nation’, to analyse the plurality of religious affiliation in India in a manner that was not divorced from Indian self-representations. While the idea of a unified religion, characterised by canonical texts, a common deity and doctrinal uniformity, doubtless played a role in later nineteenth-century constructions of Hinduism, this very idea is presupposed in current critiques of such constructions which deny that Hinduism is a religion on the basis that it lacks the qualities of a religion defined in this way.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2001.0341,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
462,Earth and Nature-Based Spirituality (Part II): From Earth First! and Bioregionalism to Scientific Paganism and the New Age,"Earth and nature-based spirituality is proliferating globally. In Part I of this study, I argued that although participants in these countercultural movements often eschew the label religion, these are religious movements, in which persons find ultimate meaning and transformative power in nature. Focusing on the deep ecology movement, I further argued that (1) experiences of nature spirituality are evoked by practices as diverse as mountaineering, neo-shamanic ritualising and states of consciousness induced by hallucinogens; (2) earthen spiritualities are often contested and may be viewed as inauthentic or dangerous by practitioners of other forms of nature spirituality, and (3) despite significant diversity, a sense of connection and belonging to nature (sometimes personified as a transforming if not transcendent power) unites these cross-fertilising, and sometimes competing, spiritualities. Part II examines additional forms of nature-oriented religion, searching further for continuities, discontinuities and ironies among its diverse forms.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0257,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
463,Defending Hindu Tradition: Sanatana Dharma as a Symbol of Orthodoxy in Colonial India,"Accounts of social and religious reform and of Hindu revivalism in late nineteenth-century India refer consistently to the idea of sanatana dharma as an indicator of ‘orthodox’ resistance to change in the context of a modernising religion. This article questions this presentation of sanatana dharma as an unmediated reactionary force. It argues that sanatana dharma as orthodoxy in fact emerged as an influential feature of the modernisation process, most particularly in the development of a doctrinally non-confrontational, pan-Hindu identity. The article then argues that this identity was critical to the conception of the Hindu nation in the early twentieth century—an idea which has subsequently developed into a significant force in Indian political and cultural life.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2001.0322,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
464,"Apparitions of the Virgin Mary in the Late Twentieth Century: Apocalyptic, Representation, Politics","How might scholars of religion understand the many and seemingly increasing apparitions of the Virgin Mary at the close of the twentieth century? This essay looks at the phenomenon from a historical point of view, focusing on the various ways devotional practices have been accepted and understood in the late twentieth century. The essay is in three parts. It begins with a descriptive overview of the phenomenon, drawing on sources as diverse as academic studies, supermarket tabloids, web sites and Vatican responses. The focus in this section is on the relationship between Marian apparitions Christian culture andfin-de-siècle apocalypticism. In the second section a closer consideration is given to the phenomenon of ‘miraculous photography’ in this evolving tradition of piety, a tradition of divination by images. The third part of the essay addresses more fully the Vatican's response to this phenomenon in light of the personal Marian piety of Pope John Paul II, especially in view of the recent proclamation of the ‘Third Secret’ of Fatima.

465,Emotions and Ethics in Buddhist History: The  Sinhala Thūpavamsa  and the Work of Virtue,"While literature is often thought to be a product of culture, the writing of history in medieval Sri Lanka was based on the assumption that texts themselves can produce changes in culture by making people into virtuous devotees. A study of the Sinhala Thūpavamsa, a Theravāda Buddhist chronicle written in Sinhala around the thirteenth century, provides new material with which to examine the ways historical narratives can be crafted to manipulate and transform the readers and listeners of a text. In this instance, the text gives rise to emotions that are productive of a moral subjectivity in those who encounter its narrative. By making persons feel that the Buddha and other virtuous agents in the past have performed deeds to benefit those in the present, the text causes devotees to view themselves as having been aided by others. The Sinhala Thūpavamsa works to constitute its readers and listeners as the moral subjects of another's acts and thus obligates them to respond accordingly. More generally, religious histories can be complex literary works that offer the scholar much more than simply descriptions of past events. The Sinhala Thūpavamsa claims for itself the aesthetic capacity to effect certain emotional and ethical responses in an audience. These efforts to compose historical narratives appear designed to instill a heightened sense of oneself as a beneficiary of history who in turn is obliged to engage in the virtuous work of ritualised devotional practices.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2001.0323,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
466,Earth and Nature-Based Spirituality (Part I): From Deep Ecology to Radical Environmentalism,"Earth and nature-based spirituality is proliferating globally. In Part I of this study, I argue that although participants in countercultural movements often eschew the label religion, these are religious movements, in which these persons find ultimate meaning and transformative power in nature. Focusing on the deep ecology movement, I further argue that (1) experiences of nature spirituality are evoked by practices as diverse as mountaineering, neo-shamanic ritualising and states of consciousness induced by hallucinogens; (2) earthen spiritualities are often contested and may be viewed as inauthentic or dangerous by practitioners of other forms of nature spirituality; and (3) despite significant diversity, a sense of connection and belonging to nature (sometimes personified as a transforming, if not transcendent power) unites these cross-fertilising and sometimes competing spiritualities. Part II examines additional forms of nature-oriented religion, searching further for continuities, discontinuities and ironies among its diverse forms.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0256,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
467,Theology Comes Home: The Role of Theology in the Academic Study of Religion and the Role of Theology of Judaism in the Academic Study of Judaism,"In the academic setting, theology examines the intellectual structure and system of a corpus of religious writings and rites. The study of religion analyses the data of religion, the texts in words and artifacts. Theology articulates the systematic consequences of those facts, the generative logic. The study of theology is particular to the study of a given religious tradition; philosophy of religion asks questions concerning religious truth claims in general. Theology of Judaism seeks evidence of the interior logic that imparts coherence to entire structure of distinct systems of that religion adumbrated in the written documents of Judaism(s). In the context of a Judaic system, that requires the identification of norms that all authorities within that system affirm.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0307,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
468,Ken Wilber's Spectrum Model: Identifying Alternative Soteriological Perspectives,"I identify two problematic strands of Ken Wilber's transpersonal theory. First, I question Wilber's claim that his spectrum model is supported by the materials of all the world's major mystical traditions. I argue that his integral, hierarchical perspective privileges some traditions but distorts others. Drawing heavily upon Andrew Rawlinson's recent, taxonomic study of mystical traditions, which identifies four authentic routes to spiritual emancipation (Cool Structured, Cool Unstructred, Hot Structured and Hot Unstructured), I argue that while Wilber's model, itself Cool (the source of spiritual liberation lies within oneself) and Structured (developmental, hierarchical), provides a valuable cartography of transpersonal structures and states of consciousness, it cannot adequately handle the materials of the alternative, soteriological paths of Hot traditions (emphasising the numinous, and as other than oneself) and of Unstructured traditions (affirming that there can be no gradual, or progressive, spiritual development at all). Second, and more cursorily, I argue that it is Wilber's Cool Structured perspective that informs his categorisation of Jung as an elevationist. I try to demonstrate that Jung's psychic model of the conjunction of opposites is a Hot Structured one, which provides an alternative, soteriological path for persons whose spiritual needs are different from those addressed by Wilber.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0306,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
469,Juggling Identities among the Crypto-Jews of the American Southwest,"The Crypto-Jews of New Mexico present a fascinating case of a modern community shaping and constructing identity in the context of competing identities. This article applies two concepts derived from structuralism as a means of examining and analysing this process. Bricolage is the primary theoretical concept. It provides the model of the different patterns which shape the construction of Crypto-Judaic identity. The second concept, that of the juggling of identities, shows the ways in which individuals with different Crypto-Jewish identities consciously and unconsciously emphasise different aspects of the underlying structural pattern. This aspect of agency creates the dynamic and transformational aspect which is significant to both Crypto-Jewish and modern identity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0313,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-31
470,Ninian Smart and the Phenomenological Approach to Religious Education,"This essay reviews and assesses Ninian Smart's contribution to religious education. Attention is given to his account of the nature and purpose of religious education as expressed and developed in a series of works published between the late 1960s and the early 1970s, beginning with The Teacher and Christian Belief (1966) and ending with Schools Council Working Paper 36, Religious Education in the Secondary School (1971), which was produced under his direction. Continuities and tensions in his thought are identified and discussed in the context of recent debates within religious education and the academic study of religion. Smart's case for non-confessional religious education is considered, as is his support for a phenomenological approach to religious education. Although serious criticisms are raised, it is concluded that his work is of abiding significance and relevance to both British education and beyond.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0291,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30
471,William James and Buddhism: American Pragmatism and the Orient,"William James pursued far-ranging enquiries in America across the fields of psychology, philosophy and religious studies between 1890 and 1910. Historical and comparative overlaps emerge between James and Buddhism from these pursuits. This article first sets out James' own nineteenth-century American context. There follows James' own more explicit references to Buddhism, which particularly focused on the meaning of the term ‘religion’ and on specific elements of Buddhist teachings. In turn comes a substantive comparative look at certain themes in both James and Buddhism, namely, ‘consciousness’, ‘integration’ and ‘criteria of truth claims’. The common functionalist tendencies in James and Buddhism are highlighted. Finally, the article attempts a wider look at the interaction between American thought and Buddhism during the twentieth century. This interaction is exemplified by John Dewey, Charles Hartshorne, Daisetz Suzuki, Kitaro Nishida and David Kalupahana, and also across the fields of psychology, pragmatism and process philosophy. In all of these areas James emerges as a significant figure for studying American thought and Buddhism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0292,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30

First, I will describe the discoveries mentioned by Darmesteter. Second, I will highlight his comments about the contributions of French scholars to the development of orientalism. Finally, I will analyse the relation between the Franco–German War (1870–71) and Darmesteter's Essais.

473,White Women and the Dark Mother,"One of the foremost champions of the ‘Dark Mother’ today is the overwhelmingly white feminist spirituality movement, based in the United States and Europe. Over the past twenty-five years, white spiritual feminists have approached the figure of the Dark Mother, which is borrowed from Hindu, African and Christian sources, with a uniquely fraught mix of longing, envy, hope, fear and guilt. This article first discusses the explicit justifications that white spiritual feminists offer for the incorporation of the Dark Mother into their religiosity, including their analysis of how the concepts of ‘lightness’ and ‘darkness’ are deployed and gendered in patriarchal religions. It then argues that, contrary to spiritual feminist claims, the Dark Mother as such does not exist cross-culturally but is rather the joint creation of the history of religions, Jungian psychology and spiritual feminist ingenuity, and that she is constructed and utilised primarily as a means of working through white racial guilt.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0276,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30

However, an analysis of both textual and visual sources points to a more complex religious environment among the Yoruba in their homeland. It is suggested that the innovations found in the New World were less radical than received wisdom indicates. In addition, such research challenges the assumption that the form of New World Orisha worship is a consequence of colonial oppression and suggests instead that it is based on existing African antecedents.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0277,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30

476,Walter Burkert and a Natural Theory of Religion,"In his studies of ancient cultures, Walter Burkert has usually focused on materials derived from Greece and the ancient Near East. In Creation of the Sacred, he examines religious universalia in order to account for the ubiquity and persistence of the phenomenon of religion and to produce a general theory of religion. The themes and problems he has examined in previous books have led him to the claim in Creation of the Sacred that religion can be traced to origins in biology, and that religion derives from biology and language as genes and culture co-evolve.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0267,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30
477,Towards a Natural History of Religion,"Taking as point of departure Walter Burkert's work, this article seeks to theorise the relationship between needing and getting, choreographed by ritual and mythology, and the formal excess that characterises religious practices. While the formal complexity that characterises ritual activity and doctrinal elaboration reminds us of the parallels between religions and the aesthetic realm, the fact that the satisfaction of the needs of organisms is sought against a background of scarcity reminds us of the role of power. It is, however, to work—that is, to what human organisms generally do in order to satisfy their needs—that one must turn, if one is to understand religion. Despite the formal parallels between the organisation of work and the organisation of rituals, and of the role played by rituals in the timing of agricultural and other kinds of labour, ‘work’ is largely absent from studies of religion. This absence, related to the turning away from concepts even vaguely connected with Marx, seems to go hand in hand with the repression of the working body in contemporary ‘theory’. Rejecting such repression, this article focuses on human labour as a key for understanding the emergence of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0268,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30
478,Walter Burkert  In Partibus Romanorum ,"Unlike his other books, Walter Burkert's Homo Necans and Creation of the Sacred both explicitly utilise evidence from Roman religion to reach their interpretive goals. But Burkert's use of that evidence is at variance with the meticulousness which has characterised his use of Hellenic evidence throughout his academic career. This article demonstrates how his use of Roman materials is at best impressionistic and incomplete; important evidence is too often missing, and too often a Hellenist's orientation apparently compromises what does appear. More detailed attention to Roman materials could sometimes improve and sometimes undercut the interpretation. Consequently, Burkert's large-scale conclusions are less inevitable than he, and his admirers, might like. Finally, explanations for these circumstances appear in the larger context of the traditional tension between Greek and Roman in the field of classical studies even today. A tacit assumption of those who specialise in Greek religion is that expertise there automatically becomes expertise in Roman religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0269,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30
479,Making the Myth–Ritualist Theory Scientific,"Working from his base in ancient Greek religion, Walter Burkert has come to propose a theory of religion generally. That theory rests on the work of ethologists and, more recently, of sociobiologists. While concentrating on ritual, which for him is the heart of religion, Burkert links ritual to myth to offer his own version of the myth–ritualist theory. Rejecting the old-fashioned view, epitomised by James Frazer, that myth and ritual function to spur the crops to grow, he maintains that the two function at once to unify society and to alleviate anxiety. Their function is sociological and psychological rather than magical. Put another way, their function is symbolic rather than practical. For Burkert, as for Frazer, myth–ritualism arose in the stage of agriculture, but for Burkert it is tied to the prior stage of hunting. How original is Burkert's theory of myth–ritualism and of religion? Why does he turn to ethology in particular? If he is seeking to provide a scientific theory of religion, what does he mean by ‘scientific’?",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0274,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30
480,Sense and Senselessness in Religion: Reflections on  Creation of the Sacred ," Creation of the Sacred posits that ‘religion makes sense’. In so doing, it underestimates ‘the negative’. Its emphasis on the scientific basis for tradition, here called ‘scientistic traditionalism’, underestimates the role of critique and the function of dissent in the dialectics of tradition-building. For this reason, it also cannot ‘make sense’ of monotheism, which, in its many traditions, positions itself in opposition to mere biological imperatives.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0275,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30

482,Job as Apologetic: The Role of the Audience,"A key to interpreting the Book of Job, following from the general methodology for the human sciences set out by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, is to regard the field in which the text is embedded as the beliefs of its audience rather than its explicit content of story and characters. Bourdieu has shown the extent to which belief and practice involve elements of uncertainty and strategy, allowing inconsistencies to be interpreted as rhetorical effects. Several conclusions follow: the main focus of the Book is honour and wisdom; belief in divine transcendence may be produced as an effect of discontinuity and uncertainty in the narrative; piety may appear as an ideological effect of a pre-monetary economic order; and the principle of temporal retribution is shown to be reinforced by the text. At the same time, the Book is shown to furnish its own critique of conventional piety and to articulate an alternative piety grounded in critique itself. Religion is not purely ideological, for piety is portrayed as a critique of the ideological effects of the symbolic order.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0241,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30

What might findings suggest about the impact of both internal organisational processes and extra-institutional pressures on the routinization of charisma? This article addresses these questions by examining the rise of Christ Apostolic Church, an Aladura church of the Yoruba of Nigeria, and focusing on the interplay of first, the global propagation of Christianity; second, colonial domination; third, symbolic reformulation; and finally, the pursuit of well-being in the face of epidemic disease. This investigation provides a case study of how people negotiate social and natural obstacles while constructing enduring institutional structures. Furthermore, it is argued that, rather than obstructing this religious movement, epidemics, colonial domination and missionary opposition fuelled its transformation into an institutional church.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.2000.0246,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30
484,The Evolution of Western Individualism,"Louis Dumont has shown how Western individualism is rooted in religion. He explained the rise of modern inworldly individualism as the result of a transformation of outworldly individualism in early Christianity, brought about by a changing Church/State relationship. In this essay, Dumont's thesis is accepted in principle, but several nuances and qualifications are added. This essay traces the development of modern individualism from the outwordly individualism of early Hellenistic times to the new idea of the person in the ‘broken’ world of early Christianity, then further to the gradual rise of inworldly individualism within the ‘unified culture’ which occurred after the Papal Revolution, and to its blossoming, together with its corollary, the ethical personality, at the beginning of the Reformation.

485,"Georges Dumézil: Theories, Critiques and Theoretical Extensions","Georges Dumézil, best known as the deviser of the theory of a tripartite patterning impulse in the cultures making up the Indo-European (I-E) linguistic group, spent sixty years refining this concept, and adding other themes such as the bifurcation of his fonctions and the concept of Interfunctional War. Before his death, his ideas were used to explain I-E patterns in cultural areas such as the Celtic, the Norse-Scandinavian and the Western medieval; since his death, his theorised structures have served as a base for such extensions as a ‘fourth’ function, a feminine potency to the formula and age-set-divisions as a part of the patterning impulse. Critics have concentrated on philological points, though some have denied the existence of the I-E tripartite division tout court. Just before Dumézil's death a variation on the ‘revisionist’ line began to accuse him of suspect personal–political opinions, and these accusations continue. The ultimate usefulness of Dumézil is the flexibility of his system and the extraordinary range of materials one can draw into his theories; his value is as a ‘medium’ for further research and theoretical structuring.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1999.0239,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-30

This new view has emerged as a result of recent archaeological discoveries and a reassessment of the testimony of the biblical text. Only a small minority of pre-exilic Israelites were developing monotheistic ideas, and they probably went through several stages of evolution until they became consistent monotheists in the Babylonian Exile. Some critical scholars suspect that this evolution may have been a totally post-exilic phenomenon.

488,The Ephesian Megabyzos Priesthood and Religious Diplomacy at the End of the Classical Period,"One element consistently cited as evidence that the feminine deities of the poleis of Ionia are aspects of a single Great Mother Goddess of fertility is the Ephesian Megabyzos priest, whose eunuch status is paralleled with the Greco-Roman eunuch priests of Cybele, the Galli. The practice of eunuchism is usually regarded as a pre-Greek or primitive element in Ephesian worship, dating back to the earliest phases of religious activity at the site. This contention is, however, a construction of the evidence coloured by nineteenth-century thinking about the development of religions and the nature of so-called ‘primitive’ societies. The evidence itself makes no claim for any great antiquity for this priesthood but rather suggests an institution of brief duration in the latter portion of the classical period. This article re-examines the evidence for the Megabyzos priesthood in terms of the political changes in and around the city of Ephesos in the fourth century B.C.E. and finds a context for the Megabyzos in the religious diplomacy between Ephesos and the Persian satrapal capital, Sardis, during the shift from Persian to Macedonian control.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1999.0164,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-29

The symbolism of the syllable (originary, universal and eternal) is based on its uses in Sanskrit.

493,‘Finding the Way’: James Legge and the Victorian Invention of Taoism,"James Legge (1815–97) is primarily known as the great missionary translator of the Confucian Classics (1861–72, 1893–95). However, after his installation as the first Professor of Chinese at Oxford University in 1876, Legge was a close associate of Max Müller and participated in the production of the Sacred Books of the East (1879–1910), the foundational documents for the new discipline known as the comparative science of religions. By virtue of his translations for Müller's Sacred Books (1891), Legge was the most important figure contributing to the late Victorian invention of ‘Taoism’ as a ‘world religion’ located ‘classically’, ‘essentially’, and ‘purely’ within certain ancient texts or ‘sacred books’, especially a single enigmatic text or Taoist ‘bible’ known as the Tao Te Ching , attributed to the sage Lao Tzu. It was Legge's Protestant (and resolutely anti-Catholic) paradigm of an early philosophically and morally pure Taoism (identified with the Tao Te Ching), as distinguished from a later ritualistic and magical Taoism (associated with the machinations of the Taoist ‘popes’) that set the context for the Western understanding of the Taoist tradition for much of the twentieth century. Recent revisionary developments in Taoist scholarship reflect some of the important methodological issues of interpreting the ‘special nature’ of Chinese religious tradition first debated by Legge and others such as Herbert Giles during the Victorian period.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1999.0187,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-29
494,The Extreme Orient: The Construction of ‘Tantrism’ as a Category in the Orientalist Imagination,"Although it has now come to be accepted as a basic part of the vocabulary of historians of religions, the category of ‘Tantrism’, as a singular abstract, and clearly defined entity is largely a product of nineteenth-century Orientalist and colonial discourse. Very quickly, moreover, this category was identified as the most extreme form of that tendency toward passion, licentiousness and moral depravity which was thought to characterize the ‘Indian Mind’. Indeed, we might say that Tantrism came to embody the ‘extreme Orient’, the most Other, that which was most diametrically opposed to the rational and progressive mind of the West. This paper traces the genealogy of the category of ‘Tantrism’ within the British colonial imagination, as it was constructed, not only in Orientalist scholarship, but also in administrative writings and in popular Victorian novels. As we will see, the discourse about Tantrism and its sexual licentiousness was part of the much broader discourse about sexuality, which, as Michael Foucault and others have shown, pervaded late nineteenth and early twentieth-century British culture. Finally, this paper will then show the ways in which the Tantras came to be defended rationalized, and ‘sanitized’ by certain more sympathetic scholars of the twentieth century—above all in the work of John Woodroffe. It is largely through the dialectical tension between these two extremes—between the Victorian horror at Tantric licentiousness, and Woodroffe's defense and de-odorization of Tantric philosophy—that this category came to be inherited by contemporary historians of religions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1997.0097,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-29

Despite Scientology's efforts to adjust its approach to fit the cultural realities of the countries that it enters, its apparent successes in some formerly Iron Curtain nations is counterbalanced by growing opposition in Western Europe.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1998.0154,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-29
496,On Rodney Stark's Foray into Early Christian History,"Rodney Stark's recent work, The Rise of Christianity , provides interesting and provocative applications of social and economic theory to the early history of Christianity, and offers cogent explanations for the eventual triumph of Christianity in the Roman Empire. Some oversimplifications are evident in his work, for example, in his comparisons of Christianity and paganism. Especially questionable are the statistical inferences that he makes in chapter six to assess the degree of ‘Christianisation’ in the 22 largest cities of the Empire. However, the strengths of his book clearly outweigh its weaknesses, and historians of early Christianity cannot afford to ignore it.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1998.0151,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-29
497,Charisma in Max Weber's Sociology of Religion,"Weber's concept of charisma has received diverse and contradictory interpretations. The essay argues that this diversity is caused less by inadequate readings of Weber than by inconsistencies in Weber's own conceptualization. Weber introduced his concept of charisma in two different contexts: his political sociology and his sociology of religion. In his political sociology he formulates the ideal type of charismatic authority informed by R. Sohm. In his sociology of religion Weber connects it with the anthropological debate of the turn of the century on magic and religion, especially the debate on pre-animism initiated by R. R. Marett, and uses it as an alternative for concepts like mana or orenda. Both conceptualizations of charisma are located on quite different levels of abstraction, which Weber has not sufficiently clarified and systematized. This leads to inconsistencies, contradictions, and overgeneralizations. Especially problematic is his claim of a supposedly anti-traditionalist or even revolutionary character of charisma. The article argues that while this claim may apply to certain types of charisma under specific conditions, many types of charisma actually seem to be integral parts of institutionalized and traditionalized social orders.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1999.0175,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-29
498,Leo Strauss and Relativism: The Critique of Max Weber,"Leo Strauss criticizes Max Weber as an historicist whose relativism mars the ethical quality of his work. Strauss suggests that Weber escapes this presumptive relativism by a religious route, namely, by grounding values in revelation and by professing to await another revelation which would save us from relativism. This paper argues, in Weber's defence, against the charges of relativism and historicism. Strauss slights Weber's own understanding of ‘value free’ scientific inquiry. Value freedom can be interpreted not only as a methodological principle but also as a moral purpose.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1999.0176,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-29
499,Max Weber on Religion and Political Responsibility,"In his two lectures on the vocations, Max Weber developed a ‘deep theory’ of responsibility focusing on: 1) a readiness to evaluate critically and repeatedly the foreseeable consequences of one's actions; 2) a willingness to abandon or change one's course if one has reason to believe such action will result in consequences detrimental to other, more valuable ends or obligations; and 3) an ability to justify one's final course of action to others. I criticize, among other things, Weber's idea that the capacity of religion to inspire political responsibility can be measured in terms of its readiness to endorse the use of physical force. I am also critical of his ethical indeterminism and his belief that life- and value-spheres are impervious to rational mediation. Nevertheless, I conclude that his consequentialist theory of responsibility was a valuable contribution to our understanding of the relationship between values and political power.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1999.0177,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-29

Images of a lost past where women were educated, free to move about, and respected ritual helpers of their husbands once served as an important rationale for arguments on behalf of women's emancipation.

The Roman Catholic Church, closely linked with the Portuguese monarchic state and its colonial ambitions, transmitted both norms in religious guidebooks, missionary letters and sermons. This summary centers on the defining role for women in marriage, and indicates that the epoch of colonial Brazil is particularly important for feminist study. With the increasingly disparate perspectives on women from Late Antiquity, the Humanists, and Counter-Reformation theologians, this early modern era saw conflicted discourse concerning traditional gender roles.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1998.0142,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-28

505,"‘Priestesses’, Playboy, and the Prehistory of Feminist Scholarship in Christianity and Crisis Magazine, 1945–1965","This is a case study of how feminist discourse emerged in a key part of the U.S. Protestant academy. It analyzes how Christianity and Crisis, a leading Protestant journal of opinion, addressed gender and sexuality from the 1940s to the mid-1960s. It relates this discussion to C&C's larger transformation from a voice of Cold War liberalism in the 1940s to a forum for feminism and various liberation theologies beginning in the 1960s. Before 1965 the main ways that C&C's all-male leadership addressed gender were masculinist rhetoric, mild support for women's ordination; defense of the bourgeois family against perceived challenges, and controversies about sexual representation in the media. Although C&C's overt attention to gender and its sympathy with feminism were limited, its self-image was based on supporting underdogs against unjust forms of power. As C&Cembraced ‘contextual’ approaches in the 1960s and debated sexual ethics, it began to conceptualize ‘contexts’ partly in terms of gender systems. All this was pre-feminist, but was in the background when feminism began to force itself on C&C during the late 1960s from inside and outside its core constituencies. It meant that C&C was relatively well prepared (compared with most journals of its kind) to incorporate female personnel, define ‘contexts’ from the standpoint of previously neglected female underdogs, and begin rethinking gender and sexuality.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1998.0144,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-28

Gender conceptions common to China's three religions—Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism—confirmed that women were allied to the passive and inner. Accounts of the only woman in Chinese history to occupy the throne in her own name, Wu Zhao, follow Chinese historians in portraying her as contravening this cosmology. Drawing on recent studies of the religious history of the body, I argue instead that Wu Zhao constructed a legitimizing strategy that took seriously, in ways not contemplated before, these fundamental tenets of Chinese religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1998.0147,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-28

Three issues are discussed: the ‘good woman’, or the impact of gendered norms and expectations upon women's destinies; women's self-construction and the possibility of women envisioning or creating their own destinies; and the becoming of the woman-subject, the desire of women collectively to accomplish their subjectivity as women.

In particular, it seeks to re-examine the theory of Cox that within the emergence of postmodernity religious expression is becoming polarized into the forms of ‘fundamentalism’ and ‘experientialism’. Cox applies this analysis to Pentecostalism and suggests that even now the battle lines are drawn between these polarities. He speculates that glossolalia could be the focus of such a debate between belief and experience within postmodernity and may provide a resource which meets the current ‘ecstasy deficit’ in human spirituality. Evidence from this case study suggests that there are some indications of a cultural shift to postmodernity and that the tensions which Cox highlights are present within the case study. However, it is unclear whether the role of glossolalia in postmodernity will be as important as Cox anticipates. Rather, this study suggests that glossolalia will become merely one symbol among many which form the ‘spiritual bricolage’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1998.0131,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-28

Over the past few decades, it has used new media technologies as well as travelling evangelists to create a worldwide network of like-minded ministries. I examine one such ministry, the Word of Life in Uppsala, Sweden, in order to consider two main questions: (1) can social scientific theories of globalization help us to understand the activities of such Christians? (2) can adherents of the Faith Movement be shown to be creating their own theories of ‘spiritualised globalization’? I conclude that Faith Christians in Sweden have developed the ideological means to resolve, at least in ideal terms, the apparent dilemma of simultaneously celebrating ‘placeless principles’ of mutual spiritual understanding and more overtly patriotic, locally bound celebrations of sacralized nationhood.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1998.0132,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-28

Drawing on current epistemological discussion, Spinoza shows in the Ethics how the pervasive anthropomorphism of popular explanations of the world, rooted in imagination, develops into religious systems. This theory informs Spinoza's analysis of biblical prophecy in his Treatise, in which he displaces the philosophical hermeneutic of Maimonides in favor of an historical-critical analysis.

518,Explaining the Great Schism: History Versus Theology,"Explaining historically rather than theologically, the separation of Christianity from Judaism asks secular methods to account for events of religion. When history settles matters of fact that to begin with pertain to questions of faith, the result is systematic apologetics set forth as secular history, e.g., the superiority of Christianity over Judaism. Christianity took leave of Judaism because of flaws in Judaism, which Christianity corrected. Or Christianity took leave of Judaism, and therefore Judaism, not Christianity, forms the continuity to the Old Testament The privileging of one over the other defines the model of description and explanation in contemporary scholarship and interfaith dialogue alike Two recent books — Jack T.

Both take for granted a single set of premises, which render the results of each indeterminate and inchoate. That is the three-part assumption: (1) we may speak of Judaism and Christianity as unitary and coherent religious entities, subject to easy generalization; (2) we also may speak of ‘the Jews’ and the Christians' as coherent social entities, also subject to facile description; (3) we may derive from literary evidence facts concerning not the opinions of the writers but the social world beyond the pages of the documents.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0062,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-28

Informed by post-colonial theories which argue for the hybridization of colonized cultures, this paper presents Kerala's St. George cult as reflecting an ambivalent stance toward foreign influences and impositions.

521,Evolutionism and Early Nineteenth-Century Histories of Religions,"Evolutionism influenced the study of religion long before Darwin. Histories of religions feature prominently in the metaphysical philosophies of history of the Romantic period; these philosophies of history, in turn, draw on an essence-and-development concept of evolution constructed within eighteenth-century biological preformationism and theosophy.1Preformationist and theosophical evolutionisms posit physiological and spiritual development of humanity. Ballanche and Schelling show how Romantic philosophers of history applied essence-and-development evolutionisms to history, to humanity and to God. For both Ballanche and Schelling, history is the unfolding in time of the essence of humanity; for both, the history of religions provides empirical corroboration for the metaphysical order underlying history. Eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century essence-and-development evolutionism historicized, and thereby reconceptualised, Christian providentialism, soteriology and theodicy.

This manuscript demonstrates the growing importance of the relationship between ethics and natural philosophy in early imperial China. Consistent with other Han attempts to reconcile conflicting Confucian models of self‐cultivation, the silk manuscript represents an adaptation of the theory of human nature developed by the followers of Mencius (Mengzi , c. 371‐c. 289 B.C.E.) to the understanding of the relationship between the body and the cosmos developed in HuangLao  technical literature. The appeal of the ‘Essay on the Five Phases’ to this discourse not only provides insight into development of Confucianism in the Han, but also provides early evidence of the attempt to synthesize models for governing the human world according to the same correlative schemata believed to govern the natural world.1 ",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1997.0080,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-28
524,The Web of Deceit: Challenges to Hindu and Muslim ‘Orthodoxies’ by ‘Bāuls’ of Bengal,"Many so-called ‘Bāuls’ of Bengal identify themselves in opposition to more conventionally religious Hindus and Muslims. Specifically they identify themselves as being in ‘barttamān’, a category basically constructed in opposition to another: ‘anumān’. An ideal of self-dependence based on one's own knowledge (barttamān) is opposed to others’ knowledge or conjecture (anumān). The latter is epitomised by Hindu or Muslim ‘orthopraxy’ or ‘orthodoxy’, which is in turn legitimised by scripture and religious authorities (priest and mullah). Those inbarttamānemphasise the ‘substance’ or ‘thing’ rather than the ‘name’ (which is identified with scripture, mantra etc.); and ‘what is seen’ (that is, one's own experience) rather than ‘what is heard’ (literally ‘hearsay’). Scriptural authority and the practices legitimised by it are at times denounced as deception. In particular distinctions between person and person are said to be cultural and contingent rather than natural. Bāul reverence for the human being subverts both Hindu image worship and the transcendent God of orthodox Islam. It is argued that this radicalism may partly be accounted for in terms of the close association and mutual influence of Hindus and Muslims within the Bāul community.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1997.0093,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-27

Historical evidence reveals that in the third century BCE India was ruled by a renowned emperor who was similarly opposed to the use of violent means to achieve political goals. By highlighting parallels between the text of the epic and the Aśokan edicts, this paper suggests that the character of Yudhisthira may have been modeled on the historical Aśoka and that the extended debates about the nature of royal dharma contained in the text may reflect ideological controversies arising from Aśoka's ideas on kingship.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1997.0092,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-27

Here the work of Ernst Troeltsch is used to theorize the fundamental unity of the ‘conservative and revolutionary tendencies’ within Christian social thought.

530,"Phenomenology, Religious Education, and Piaget","This paper examines phenomenology and its psychological relationship to religious education. It comments on this relationship in the light of the critique of phenomenology which Piaget himself made towards the end of his life (Piaget, 1965), though it also draws attention to other aspects of phenomenology theory which are dissonant with Piagetian psychology. This paper, therefore, is not a broad philosophical critique of phenomenology, though an element of this is included. but concentrates on the philosophical and developmental factors which impede the capacity of young people to perform either of the ‘reductions’ demanded by the phenomenological method.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1997.0083,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-27
531,The Protestant Ethic in Hungary,"While in the 16–17th centuries about two thirds of Hungarians belonged to the Reformed Church, the presence of the ‘spirit of capitalism’ and the ‘Protestant ethic’ is rather questionable. The Calvinists did not play a different or decisive role in the capitalization process of Hungary at the end of the 19th century. This study is a summary of a much longer analysis of the ‘Hungarian Protestant ethic’ of the 17th century. The historical analysis focuses on the Puritan doctrines which can be found in conduct-books as well as the practical religiosity of Hungarian Puritans and Reformed people in that age. The ‘Hungarian Protestant ethic’ differs from Weber's ideal-type in two respects: the Hungarian version is more pietistic, less activist; and it seems to have less practical influence in everyday life because of weak religiosity. The Hungarian case does not refute Weber's thesis, but it does call attention to two important parts of historical analysis: the reinterpreting, selecting procedure in social context, and the intensity of religiosity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0050,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-27
532,Jesuits and the State: A Comparative Study of their Expulsions (1590–1990),The Society of Jesus constitutes a remarkable example of permanence and universality; therefore it is an ideal laboratory for studying the troubled relations national institutions entertained with such a supranational congregation. In the first part of the paper the conflicting interests of both parties are analysed; it is then noticed that historically the expulsions form four successive waves and the question of contagion of anti-Jesuits policies is discussed. Furthermore it is shown (as far as permitted by available sources) that in each individual country the methods used in order to set up and to enforce the expulsions show a high degree of continuity over the course of three centuries.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0048,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-27

Taking as its central case study Earth First!, the radical vanguard of this movement, it describes the diverse forms such borrowing takes, the plural American indian and non-indian views shaping the ensuing controversy, and the threats this controversy poses to a nascent and fragile Indigenous-Environmentalist alliance.

Examining the methodology employed by the 16th-century Cairene sheikh in interpreting his own dreams, the study places al-Sha‘rânâ within the context of sufi and medieval Islamic traditions of dream interpretation.

536,The Role of Visions in Contemporary Egyptian Religious Life,"Visions play a pivotal role in the religious life of both major religious communities of Egypt, the Muslims and the Coptic Christians.1These visions may take the form of dreams, appearances of light, or apparitions. Classifying dreams under the category of visionary experiences considerably extends the field of participants in what might otherwise be considered the preserve of the rare mystic, the type of person Maxime Rodinson described as ‘pathological’ and ‘exceptional,’ though, paradoxically, he also suggested that the ‘abnormal’ psyche is not far removed from the ‘normal.’2Although William James had decried the ‘medical materialism’ which dismisses religious experience as symptoms of organic dysfunction, he too described the visionary experience as the preserve of eccentrics, of religious leaders subject to abnormal psychical visitations.3The tendency of Western scholars is to see visionary experience as both rare and symptomatic of psychic imbalance. What is striking about the Egyptian case is the frequency with which visions occur—all kinds of visions—and not only with those whom we would characterize as unusual or psychically imbalanced. Another striking feature of visionary experiences among Egyptians is the similarity of the nature and significance of these experiences among the two major confessional communities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0051,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-27

Likewise, since their emergence in the 1970s, the Nigerian Charismatic movements, through their numerous published pamphlets, Bible studies, magazines, etc. have built up teachings about sexual patterns and marriage for their members as part of the pietistic character of the movements. Charismatics believe that sexuality and matrimony have much bearing on spiritual commitments. The grounds for such a new style of living include the perceived crisis in social and family life in the society, and the need to maintain doctrinal purity as converts join the movements.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0065,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-27
538,Western Buddhism: Tradition and Modernity,"The idea of a fragmented, de-traditionalized society has been much discussed over recent years. While Anthony Giddens has suggested that the issues surrounding postmodernism and postmodernity do not constitute the end of modernism and modernity, there has been a significant disjunction in the modernist narrative. Indeed, the project of modernity has been instrumental in the perceived de-traditionalization of society through an intensification of globalization where local contexts are invaded by abstract systems. In this paper, using the existence of Buddhism in the West as an example, I argue that this does not signify the end of tradition as such. Introducing certain aspects of Theravada Buddhist philosophy as a means of comparison, I further argue that it is possible to reclaim a place for religion by suggesting that traditions may exist in their own cultural niches which appear throughout society; as well as at various times during the life of an individual. This I call a de-universalized society in which religious tradition persists, albeit not in an inclusive form.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0025,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-26

Attention is drawn in broad terms to the parallels between sociological and religious approaches, and a contrast made specifically between a sociology of religion cast in terms of a narrative of decline and diversity (or an account of the place of religion in the perspective of modernity), and one that pays primary attention to indigenous patterns of meaning.

The article identifies three approaches to the spiritual dimension in contemporary terminal care—a religious approach, an ecclesiastical approach and an approach that identifies the spiritual as the search for meaning. Though the ecclesiastical approach dominates practice, the ‘meaning’ approach is becoming fashionable and represents a highly individualized, postmodern variety of religion with similarities to the New Age—a surprising conjunction in those hospices with a Christian foundation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0029,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-26
542,Truth in Flux: Goddess Feminism as a Late Modern Religion,"Goddess feminism is a new emancipatory religion which appears to typify postmodern religion, but which, using Anthony Giddens' social theory, I prefer to understand as having a peculiarly late modern reflexive character. And it is, I suggest, Goddess religion's reflexivity that imposes immense strains on its capacity to be or become the world-altering religion most of its adherents would want it to be. This religion is founded within a modern political struggle to bring about the demise of patriarchy: a system of non-relation held to be global and structurally continuous over 5000 years. Goddess feminism is premised on the necessity of a collective moral confrontation with patriarchy and the planetary injustice and suffering it causes. And yet thealogians' reflexive criticism of the authoritative nature of traditions makes them unable to ground their religion in a fully collective, normative, ontological and moral account of the Goddess. Goddess feminists' struggle for sexual, economic and environmental justice may also be impeded by their configuration of the Goddess as a female trinity whose hypostases sacralise moral ambiguity and by their resistance to divine and human authoritative judgements. My task in this paper is not that of arguing for the truth or falsity of thealogical claims, but that of showing how Goddess religion's late modern reflexivity is both liberative and may ultimately stunt its own development.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0016,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-26
543,"Religion, Philosophy and Family Resemblances","Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblances has been adopted by some writers either to explain the use of the word ‘religion’ or to advocate a use in the context of a definition. The purpose of this definition is supposedly to avoid an essentialist definition of religion such as ‘belief in God or gods’ which is seen as too parochially tied to Judaeo-Christian theistic origins of the word, while at the same time guaranteeing a distinctive role for religion as a universally applicable analytical concept. However, if an essentialist definition is not smuggled in for the purpose of maintaining a distinction between the ‘religion’ family and other neighbouring families such as ideologies, worldviews, values or symbolic systems, then the family becomes so indefinite that the word ceases to pick out any distinctive aspect of human culture. And this definitional dilemma in fact reflects the actual use of the word ‘religion’ by the scholarly community. Analysis of ‘religion’ texts shows that the word is used in such a large range of contexts that it is devoid of analytical value. Consequently, there is an obligation on the community of scholars to reconceptualize the wide and valuable range of work which is being carried out in ‘religion’ departments.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0017,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-26

Although a constant in this discussion is the basic understanding of Vedanta as the core, essential truth of all religions, the presentation of Vedanta has changed in differing social and political situations. This paper examines how one Hindu community has sought to define Hinduism and construct its own sense of identity over time, focusing particularly on the ways in which the definition of Hinduism has been modified since India became an independent, secular state.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0018,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-26

Using Higginbotham's idea of the Black church as a ‘discursive, critical arena’, I show how Black religionists constructed a rhetoric of equality, challenging the themes of unity that pervaded the Parliament.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, European travellers, missionaries, and magistrates cited this anchor as evidence of religion among indigenous people in the region. By the end of the century, however, this same anchor was being used by metropolitan theorists as a classic piece of evidence for the origin of religion.

549,"Zorba The Buddha: Capitalism, Charisma and the Cult of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh","This essay suggests a new way of understanding the notorious Indian guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, by examining the intimate relationship between his religious teachings and his business practices. Rajneesh's ideal was in fact that of ‘Zorba the Buddha’, the perfect synthesis of the spiritual and material, the religious and capitalist impulses. After analysing and criticizing the classical Weberian concept of ‘charisma’, this paper argues that charismatic authority is by no means incompatible with bureaucratic organization or rational business practices. On the contrary, not only can charismatic authority be combined with a complex bureaucratic organization, but it can also be transformed into a kind of ‘commodity’ which is bought and sold on the consumer market. Rather than a ‘routinization of charisma’ what we find in the Rajneesh movement is a kind of ‘commodification’ and ‘commercialization’ of charisma. Bhagwan offered (and sold) his followers the promise of the same charismatic authority and divine freedom which he himself enjoyed (though, in practice, this authority could never actually be attained by any of his followers). Moreover, charismatic authority became the basis for a new kind of bureaucratic organization in Rajneesh's world-wide network of commercial enterprises—an organization characterized by a high degree of fluidity and flexibility, able to adapt itself rapidly to meet the changing demands of its consumer market.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1996.0013,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-26

Lohorung themselves do not formulate as a separate arena of values and meaning all that commentators want to call religious and since their world view is rooted in inter-relatedness between human beings, nature and superhuman beings, the paper questions the appropriateness of religion as an interpretive framework within which to understand the Lohorung material.

557,"Ancestors, the sacred and God: Reflections on themeaning of the sacred in Zimbabwean death rituals","This paper holds that the sacred refers to the central and most fundamental reality for believers which, although wholly other, is manifested through worldly objects or events (hierophanies). In this view, the concept of God also becomes a hierophany of the sacred through symbols and is neither higher nor lower than the hierophanies of the sacred which do not refer to a Supreme Being. An examination of three contemporary field descriptions of traditional death rituals in Zimbabwe shows that although references to the Supreme Being (Mwari) are entirely lacking, the sacred reality is overwhelmingly present through ancestral spirits mediated largely through religious specialists. In contrast to this view, African Christian theologians have stressed the central role of God in African l∽eligions in part as a reaction to misrepresentations by Westerners of African rehgiosity. The emphasis by scientists and historians of religion on Mwari in Zimbabwe, however, is not as easily explained and may represent different agendas which should be acknowledged so that the rituals themselves can shed light on the meaning of the sacred for believers.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2805%2980019-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
558,A christian confession possessed by nationalisticparoxysm: The case of Serbian Orthodoxy,"This article opens with an analysis of the behaviour of Serbian Orthodoxy and the Serbian Orthodox Church in the grave crisis in former Yugoslavia by insisting upon the relevance of the case for contemporary sociology of religion on four counts: (1) Serbian Orthodoxy has been self-defined as a religious confessions on the frontier and from the frontier. (2) It has been conceived of as nowadays facing, in a very drastic and direct way, some of the contemporary challenges, many other Eastern European Orthodox Churches are also going, or may be going, to face tomorrow. (3) It is a Christian confession involved and deliberately engaged in a cruel war going on European soil. (4) It may stimulate an unbiased debate upon some aspects of the current religious situation of wider interests for the sociology of religion. The crucial thesis of the paper is that Serbian Orthodoxy and Serbian Orthodox church .have been deliberately engaged in the current war by supporting and giving a superior legitimacy in religious terms to the Serbian nationalist political strategy, basically inspired and pursuing as its crucial ideal that expressed pregnantly by G. Mazzini's formula: 'On nation one state, and only one state for every nation' in a pluri-religious, pluri-cultural and pluri-national area. The article then tries to identify the moments in the actual cultural profile of contemporary Serbian Orthodoxy which have made such an option to legitimize nationalist political strategy acceptable to it. These moments are: (a) a presumed indissoluble synthesis between Orthodoxy and the Serbian nationality making Orthodoxy the fundamental constitutive element of the Serbian nationhood as such, (b) a traditional suport for the Serbian national state, derived from the necessary confessional support for the Serbian nation, (c) a very specific vision of Serbian history seen as a century-long martyrdom of Serbian people, interpreted primarily as a consequence of the genuine dedication of the Serbian people to God's kingdom and celestial values, (d) the still prevailing traditionalism, (e) a specific view of Orthodoxy in general as the main victim of Bolshevik repression aiming to break Russian Orthodoxy as the backbone of Orthodoxy as such, (0 a revived Orthodox tradition of a manifest anti-Occidentalism.

560,The Anthropocentric Bias in Eliade's Interpretation of the Samkhya and the Samkhya-Yoga Systems of Religious Thought,"In spite of the idea of selves transmigrating between embodiments in plants, animals, humans and divinities, constituting a cosmic ecology, being fundamental in Hindu religions, Mircea Eliade in his famous books on Yoga denied this dogma in his presentation of the Samkhya and Yoga systems of religious thought. This denial makes Samkhya and Yoga appear uncompromisingly anthropocentric and their understanding of the religious position of the human species and the relationship between the human species and the world appears more similar to the Western religious traditions than it actually is. This paper tries to answer three questions: (1) Why did Eliade choose to misrepresent the Samkhya and Yoga position; (2) How did the Samkhya and Yoga systems actually conceive of the religious position of human and non-human living beings; and (3) What was the basis and the purpose for their systems of classification of living beings?",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0020,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
561,"Fundamental Rites? Religion, State, Education and the Invention of Sacred Heritage in post-Christian Britain and pre-War Japan","This paper considers recent developments in the relations between state, education and religion in Britain in the light of analogous developments in pre-war Japan. The discussion focuses on the emergence of a government-sponsored state cult developed in the late 19th century and retrospectively referred to as ‘state Shinto’. Defined as ‘non-religious’ and disseminated through the school system, it eventually incorporated all other Japanese religions. The analogy with contemporary Britain involves an examination of the background and content of the 1988 Education Reform Act and subsequent (1994) government ‘Guidance’ to schools, particularly in relation to schools religious worship and Religious Education (RE). The analogy with pre-war Japan highlights shifts in the ‘constitutional topography of the sacred’, only partially achieved so far in Britain, whereby religious authority passes from ‘real’ religions to the state, and is then disseminated through the education system as morality.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0021,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
562,Articles of Faith: The Media Response to Maria Devi Khristos,"After lifting their prohibitions on independent religious organizations, the countries of the former Soviet Union have found themselves facing an unanticipated problem: the appearance of home-grown ‘cults’. In November of 1993, one such group, the Great White Brotherhood of Maria Devi Khristos, brought public life to a near standstill in Kiev, Ukraine, as the country prepared itself for the mass suicide of 144,000 cultists. In reality, the sect turned out to be much smaller than earlier assumed, and its members had not been planning to end their lives. The present study demonstrates that a poor understanding of the Brotherhood's doctrine led to media-spawned hysteria. Yet despite the repeated failures of the media to understand the Brotherhood's plans, close examination of Maria Devi's writings and articles in the post-Soviet press reveals that the Great White Brotherhood and the reporters who covered them shared a common discourse and common assumptions about the power of the supernatural and the dangers of technology.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0022,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25

Their bodies—some showing signs of violence suffered before the fires—were found in the incinerated centres of a neo-Templar movement called originally International Order of Chivalry Solar Tradition or, for short, Solar Tradition, and after 1990-91 Order of the Solar Temple. The movement is part of one of several currents which as a whole compose the universe of the contemporary occult-esoteric movements, the neo-Templar tradition. In this paper I propose to trace, first of all, the history of the neo-Templar tradition, then that of the Solar Temple, relating the essential information on the tragedy of October 1994, and finally suggesting some possible interpretations.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0023,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
564,New Mutations of the Protestant Ethic among Latin American Pentecostals,"This article argues that there is a partial consonance between the ‘inner-worldly asceticism’ of the fast-growing Protestant movement in Latin America and the economic imperatives of the global capitalism into which Latin America has been progessively incorporated since the 1960s.This consonance stops short of being an unequivocal ‘elective affinity’ since there are also points of tension between the new Protestant ethic and the spirit of contemporary capitalism. It is argued that such consonance as exists arises out of a complex symbiosis rather than a simple one-way causal relationship. The article outlines the range of views among Latin American Pentecostal Protestants about the implications of their faith for economic behaviour, and relates these views to current economic conditions. It suggests that certain Protestant habits and values minimally assist economic survival and can even lead to modest success. Particular attention is paid to recent developments in the Pentecostal movement in Latin America which diverge from the classic Protestant ethic of the West, notably the emergence of an indigenous prosperity gospel and a selective acceptance of consumerism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0011,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25

It constitutes the greater part of what is now one of the largest practising Protestant communities in the world. However, there have been virtually no academic histories of the phenomenon. The current article, drawing heavily on the author's doctoral thesis, examines the six most important Pentecostal churches as dynamically evolving institutions. They are studied in terms of three waves of institutional creation, emphasizing the flexibility of Pentecostalism's relationship to Brazilian culture and the historical constraints on the development of each group.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0012,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25

But how Pentecostalism figures in the lives of Pentecostals so that some are indeed akin to stereotype and others are active, critical citizens involved in radical politics, remains a matter for debate. This paper argues that variation in type of citizenship among Brazilian Pentecostals may be understood not only in terms of variations in religious culture but also in terms of different types of conversion. It is proposed that reference to types of conversion, as distinguished by some theologians, helps explain why Pentecostals who share elements of a common religious culture nevertheless differ in type of citizenship; and why some Pentecostals and Catholics of the ‘base communities’, though different in their religious cultures, nonetheless share a common quality of critical citizenship.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0013,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
567,"Origins, Development and Perspectives of La Luz del Mundo Church","The objective of this paper is to describe and explain the historical origin of the native Pentecostal Luz del Mundo Church as a typical religious movement which emerged during times of social and political conflicts, but unlike most radical and counter-ideological social movements, this church has been able to develop and transform itself into a long-term religious project. Taking elements from Mexican culture and even from the dominant Catholic culture, it has created a syncretic religion that is attractive to a significant spectrum of people within the country and among Latin people beyond Mexican frontiers. It has evolved into an authoritarian church which functions around two powerful charismatic figures, able to inspire the construction of strong new identities in the believers. The Church has developed a coherent system of hierarchy in order to sustain its authority and control over the membership. The religious movement has maintained to present times its original holistic project which provides people with spiritual as well as material needs. Within a dominant Catholic culture where protestant churches have a low status, La Luz del Mundo has managed to create a strategic alliance with the Mexican state in order to counteract the Catholic influence, and its friendly relation with government has given acknowledgement and legitimation to this particular pentecostal church.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0014,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25

569,Anthropomorphism and Spinoza's Innovations,"The first and most rigorous early modern discussion of anthropomorphism in religion was produced by Benedict Spinoza. The intellectual context for his consideration was the problem posed by biblical anthropomorphism for the philosophical reader. This problem had been treated by Muslim and Jewish philosophers and was the central issue for Maimonides in his Guide of the Perplexed. Spinoza's major contributions in two areas—biblical interpretation and the study of religion—can be understood from the starting-point of his critical reconsideration of anthropomorphism. By showing that the Bible's anthropomorphism is irreducible and therefore cannot be philosophically ‘demythologized’ without distorting the text's historical meanings, Spinoza established the presuppositions for both historical and literary interpretation. Further, by applying his general analysis of religion itself as intrinsically anthropomorphic to analysis of biblical religion, Spinoza brought the study of the Bible into the orbit of the modern study of religion as inherently comparative, historical and critical.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25

For Tylor, religion and science are incompatible because they offer incompatible explanations of the physical world. For Tylor, the religious explanation is inherently anthropomorphic: it attributes all events to the decisions of gods. By contrast, the scientific explanation ascribes events to impersonal, mechanical processes. Yet for all Tylor's preoccupation with anthropomorphism as the heart of the religious explanation, he never makes clear why the religious explanation is necessarily anthropomorphic, why an anthropomorphic explanation is necessarily unscientific, and why an anthropomorphic explanation is necessarily false.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0003,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
572,Religion as Anthropomorphism: A New Theory that Invites Definitional and Epistemic Scrutiny,"This essay will focus briefly on (1) a definitional and (2) an epistemic analysis of Stewart Guthrie's cultural-anthropological theory of anthropomorphism in his bookFaces in the Clouds. In Part I of the essay, I will examine specific definitional claims about religion that Guthrie advances in chapter 1 (‘The Need for a Theory’) and chapter 3 (‘The Origin of Anthropomorphism’). In Part II, crucial statements in chapter 6 (‘Anthropomorphism in Philosophy and Science’) and chapter 7 (‘Religion as Anthropomorphism’) raise questions about Guthrie's epistemic assumptions that in philosophy and science the objects referred to as anthropomorphic have critically been known to be errors and have been wisely set aside in the margins of those enterprises, whereas the objects referred to as anthropomorphic in religion have always been at the centre of religion. Guthrie employs five theoretical criteria (of observability, simplicity, generality, fallibility, and probability) to explain why religion always anthropomorphizes. The essay concludes with a formal question about the epistemic status of Guthrie's observability and universality criteria.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25

In doing so it rejects the received view thatanekāntavāda's exclusive function is to promote non-violence at the intellectual level. Instead it advances a model which emphasizes the way in whichanekāntavādasustains a real connection between karmic matter and the soul (jīva) and so maintains the rationale for identity defining ascetic practice. The social and religious dangers of one-sided (ekānta) views for the Jaina tradition are demonstrated by a consideration of the Digambara teacher Kundakunda's idiosyncratic use of the two truths model of reality.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0006,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
574,The Search for Iconographic Variation in Roman Mithraism,"This paper concerns the interpretation of iconography in the absence of any confirmatory textual explanation. Variations in iconographical representation are often considered as indicators of doctrinal variation rather than in the context of artistic style. This is particularly important when the icons examined are apparently of primary significance in the belief system under scrutiny. A detailed analysis of one specific example of Mithraic iconography reveals significant variations, both in location and in composition. Throughout the Roman Empire, significant differences have also occurred between examples found within the same regions, making the suggestion that iconographic variation equals theological variation difficult to sustain. In support of the work of E. Will, this paper suggests that regional artistic influences may have played a greater significance in the development of Mithraic icons than many present academics would allow. Further, this paper suggests that the evidence indicates that the Mithraic canon of iconographic representation was sufficiently flexible for the individualization of Mithraic monuments, and for elements of one scene to be ‘borrowed’ and incorporated into another.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0007,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
575,The Remnants of Desire: Sacrificial Violence and Sexual Transgression in the Cult of the Kāpālikas and in the Writings of Georges Bataille,"Notorious for its transgressive sexual and sacrificial practices, the Śaivite sect of the Kāpālikas, or skull bearers, has long been misunderstood by historians of religions. This essay suggests a new way of approaching the Kāpālikas by using some of the insights of the controversial French thinker, Georges Bataille. By examining the symbolism of sacrifice and sexuality, beheading and castration, and the dialectic between taboo and transgression, this paper argues against many past interpretations, like that of Mircea Eliade. The Kāpālikas, it is argued, were not simply attempting to escape the world of history and death by transcending the duality of purity and impurity and achieving a state of other worldly detachment. Rather, they were deliberately playing upon and exploiting the dangerous, transgressive power on the margins of the social order, as a source of this-worldly power and liberation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1995.0008,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-25
576,When festinger fails: Prophecy and the watch tower,"Within its history, the Watch Tower has often set dates for the coming of Christ's millennial reign. The ability of Jehovah's Witnesses to endure the failure of these interpretations of Biblical prophecy reveals the power of the Watch Tower to withstand what would seem to be fatal challenges to its system of belief. In what has become a classic study, the social psychologist Leon Festinger has argued that such disconfirmations of prophecy lead only to deepened conviction and increased proselytism to persuade others that the original belief was correct. Applying Festinger's hypothesis to the prophetic speculation of the Watch Tower, I argue that his model fails to recognize how complex organizations and systems of belief shape responses to disconfirmed prophecy. Indeed, the history of Jehovah's Witnesses demonstrates that organizational structure and ideology constitute crucial variables for any analysis of reaction to prophetic failure. It is the very power of the Watch Tower as a millenarian movement that allows not only the rationalization of disconfirmation but the retrospective denial of the prophecy itself.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1994.1025,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-24

The kotel is viewed as a pilgrimage site, a ‘place of memory’, and a location linked to a story. Most discussions of the kotel stress its history and archaeology, while this study utilizes ethnography to understand the meanings of the site to a range of social categories. The challenge faced by ethnography is that the social context of the kotel is constituted by Jewish groups all over the world and by cultural distillates stemming from millennia of history. By providing both an overview of kotel activities, and a more detailed examination of several kotel occasions, the paper points to the potential contribution of ethnography to understanding national‐religious shrines.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1994.1026,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-24

Reviewed and critically evaluated are Mac Linscott Ricketts's interpretation that the essence of Eliade's scholarship can be seen in his early Romanian experiences and writings; Carl Olson's interpretation that EEade's scholarship is essentially theological and philosophical; and David Cave's interpretation that Eliade's scholarship is essentially based on his spiritual vision of a new humanism. Interpretations of Eliade's historical consciousness and his Christianity are criticized. Next, using these three defenders and several critics, the recent controversy about Eliade's politics and the political nature of his scholarship is considered. Finally, questions are raised as to whether Eliade's defenders have blurred or collapsed certain legitimate scholarly distinctions, thus rendering his scholarship even more vulnerable to attack.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1994.1027,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-24

586,A new religious and healing movement in the Philippines,"This article aims to extend the scholarly understanding of new religious movements by applying a new conceptual framework to the analysis of a movement in a country which has so far received scant attention in the West for its religious innovations. The analysis breaks new ground in three ways. First, it describes the beliefs and practices of participants in Pranic Healing, a new religious and healing movement in the Philippines which has never been studied before. Evidence collected in an empirical examination of this movement in Manila shows that, contrary to many theoretical expectations, Pranic Healing has attracted relatively wealthy and well‐educated followers who aspire to integrate their new‐found spiritual and therapeutic interests into their working lives as professionals or business people. Second, the article attempts to account in part for the socio‐economic profile of Pranic Healing participants in terms of the affinities that they experience between their educational and professional experiences on the one hand and the movement's teachings, practices and forms of organization on the other hand. Informants tended to attribute their attraction to Pranic Healing to these affinities. Third, and again contrary to many theoretical expectations, interviews with participants generated evidence that the holistic stance of Pranic Healing disposes them towards an ethic of global responsibility as well as towards a search for material prosperity and personal growth. The conclusion is that the prevailing wisdom about the attractions of new religious movements and about their implications for participants’ life styles will have to be modified to take full account of Pranic Healing and similar new religious healing movements.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1994.1010,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-24

588,Reflexive modernity and the religious body,"There are a growing number of attempts to reconsider the nature and role of contemporary religion with reference to the issues of ‘postmodernity’ and ‘postmodernism’. Against these, it is suggested here that efforts to reconstruct the study of religion within the framework of an assumption that we are entering a postmodern social order would be fundamentally misconceived. While the emergence of features within the present social order are acknowledged, which undermine major components of the modern project, and are manifest as problematizations of the questions of reality and meaning which concern the postmodernists, it is not accepted here that this order itself is in a state of decay. Instead, that postmodernity is a fundamentally modern construct is argued, how the very idea of postmodernity becomes possible is explored, suggesting that it is, in part, the product of a process of ‘disembodiment’ which has gradually come to dominate Western cultures since the time of the Protestant Reformation. Postmodernism is characterized by a mentalism which ignores the anthropological in reality of what we term the religious body; the necessary implication of embodiment in the human construction of meaning and identity. It is proposed therefore, that the study of contemporary religion should be shaped not by postmodernism but by an awareness of both the reality‐threatening impulses of reflexive modernity and the continuing anthropological reality of the religious body.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1994.1002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-24

Marie de Souza Canavarro, an American advocate and interpreter of Asian traditions, was a paradigmatic seeker in an age of religious wandering. Along the way, she embraced Catholicism, Theosophy, Buddhism, Bahá'í, and Hinduism. In this article I offer an interpretation of her life and work, drawing on her novels, poems, letters, lectures, articles, and autobiography. I argue that amidst the diversity of views she affirmed, there was some continuity.

Yet, it is the purpose of the following pages to outline an interpretation of Maimonides’ philosophy of religion according to which supplicatory prayer and intellectual meditation are not disparate spiritual phenomena, but complementary dimensions of a distinctive form of ethical‐intellectual worship.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1994.1004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-24
591,Japanese religion as ritual order,"It is argued in this paper that beneath the superficial analysis of Japanese ‘religions’ such as Buddhism, Shinto, Confucianism and the New Religions, there is one dominant ideological complex which, following some Japanese scholars, can conveniently be dubbed ‘The Japanese Religion’ or Nihonkyo. This Japanese religion is a ritual order based on the hierarchical concept of ‘ie’ and its variations such as ‘kigyoushugi‘1 at the level of the company and ‘katei‘2 at the domestic level. This ritual order pervades all major institutions in Japan and the main mechanism for its reproduction is the school system. In analysing the latter a distinction between training and education is adopted, and it is argued that the concept of liberal education, which is based on the concept of the autonomous rational and moral individual, is essentially missing from the Japanese school system which is better described as a system of training. It is suggested further that training can be linked conceptually with ritual: training is a form of ritualized behaviour though with a heavily pragmatic content. It is hoped that the approach to Japanese religion which is argued here will prove more fruitful in the Religious Studies context than one which begins with an explicit or implicit concept of religion centred on beliefs about salvation, the supernatural and life after death.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1027,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23
592,"The visions of Luciano Perez, contemporary native American Shaman","This paper presents an interview on the visions of the contemporary Native American shaman Luciano Perez. Born of southern Mexican Indian (P'urepecha) ancestry in Laredo, Texas, on 31 December 1950, he was trained in shamanic practice by the Lakota Sioux spiritual leader Leonard Crow Dog. He begins the interview with general comments on visions, how he experiences them and how they have matured him as a visionary providing him with spirit contact, revelation and power. He then remembers visions in childhood of the ‘little people’ and of hearing voices calling him. His first adult experience was a revelatory vision at the beginning of his spiritual quest (1973). Finally, he reports a healing vision from 1989 in a chiropractor's office where he sought medical help for severe back pain.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1028,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23

For students of the history of cartography, however, the mappaemundi represent the nadir of the science of map‐making, bearing witness to the thousand‐year period which saw the abandonment of carefully‐calculated spatial representation and the emergence in its place of religious cosmography. To cartographers, these maps, bearing no resemblance to objective reality, are of little or no scientific value, but merely a reminder of a truly Dark Age.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1019,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23

One figure to do so, however, was Ronald Nixon, who later came to be known by the name Krishnaprem and was recognized as a Hindu saint by many Indians of his day. This paper explores the life and thought of Krishnaprem by examining both his own published works and private sources. It investigates the way in which he negotiated resistant boundaries within Hindu culture and highlights the nature of his move from those dimensions of Hindu culture that were publicly acceptable to Western intellectuals into those private realms which were not. The life story of Ronald Nixon provides good opportunity for cross‐cultural considerations and challenges many of the assumptions held in the academy regarding cultural boundaries.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1020,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23
596,Deviant scripturalism and ritual satanic abuse part one: Possible Judeo‐Christian influences,"Sociologists are locked in a contentious debate with mental health personnel over the reality of intergenerational satanic abuse. Prominent sociologists insist that the satanic accounts are part of a moral panic fuelled by the media, conservative churches, and professionals who use directive, suggestive, or leading questions in their counselling and interviewing sessions. Many therapists, in contrast, are convinced that the intensity of their clients’ horrific memories along with the basic similarities of many clients’ accounts strongly suggest that the ritual abuse accounts are true. Drawing from the discipline of religious studies, this study argues that readily accessible religious texts that often are central to our culture may provide inspiration to people who either want to sanctify their deviance or venerate the reputed god of this world (i.e. Satan). Using interviews and diaries from several alleged survivors, this study compares excerpts from their accounts with doctrinal precedents for satanic ritual abuse in deviant interpretations of the Judeo‐Christian tradition. While the article stops short of stating that intergenerational satanic accounts are true, it insists that at least some of them are plausible.1 ",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1021,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23
597,The new social psychology of France: The Girardian School,"Like Lacan, Girard's thought is centered not on appetite for objects but on the relation between the self and the subjectivity of the other, in this case by way of what Girard calls ‘mimesis’, a tendency to imitate not only the actions but also the inward attitudes, and especially the desires, of others; prompted by a sense of deficiency, we seek out something to desire, hoping to attain through it the ontological plenitude symbolized for us by the (god‐like) ‘mediator’ or model of our desire. Girard's theory of social origins is rooted in the idea that mimesis leads to generalized conflict which becomes resolved through a ‘victimizing mechanism’ culminating in a ‘sacrifice’. Girardian political economists, such as Paul Dumouchel, Jean‐Pierre Dupuy, and André Orléan, have drawn on these ideas in analyzing market mechanisms and the concepts of wealth and value. Jean‐Michel Oughourlian, a psychiatrist, has applied them to the analysis of suggestion and hypnosis, hysteria, and possession. The Girardian economists’ unmasking of the idea of wealth as an idol symbolizing our fascination with images of ontological plenitude adds a new element to the traditional Christian critique of avarice as well as the Buddhist critique of desire, and Oughourlian's analysis of the phenomena of possession and sorcery throws a new light both on traditional Wester demonology and on rituals of possession.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1023,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23

Another task is to locate the New Age with reference to the premodern, the modern and the postmodern ‘conditions’.

The article explores New Age concepts of the soul and of reincarnation, the basis for these beliefs and the effect they have on care of the dying, the willingness of New Age carers to let the dying person be him or herself, and New Age theodicies. It is concluded that the New Age concern with the soul of the dying represents a significant attempt to reverse the secularization of death, though the success of this endeavour may be undermined by emphasis on the variety of personal experience and meaning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1012,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23

603,The puzzling rabbis,"Religion is one of the cultural systems that attempts to deal with human puzzlement. This paper uses the metaphor of the puzzle to make sense of what has always been a disconcerting feature of rabbinic Judaism, namely, the rabbis’ (200–600 C.E.) blatantly ad hoc manner of interpreting Scripture. The rabbis seem to know in advance what a verse must mean and go to great lengths to find a legitimation of that reading in the verse in question. Typically this ad hoc quality of rabbinic interpretation is explained as a means whereby the rabbis provide ‘prooftexts’ for new practices without Scriptural warrants. But what from one perspective appears as an attempt to find prooftexts is from another perspective an attempt to solve a puzzle. Conceptually speaking, solving a puzzle and finding prooftexts are worlds apart. This paper treats the rabbis as an inter‐generational community of puzzle solvers involved in the quest to discover how the oral Torah is already contained in the written Torah. Like all matching puzzles, this one is necessarily ad hoc.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1001,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23

More than just an early modern example of the spurious medieval ‘ritual murder accusation’, the case provides stark evidence of the complexity of anti‐semitic ideas and of the critical role still maintained by religion and religious images in fueling gentile prejudice, even on the cusp of the modern era. A thorough dissection of this case— including pivotal sections of the transcripted testimony of soldiers, housewives, tailors, and merchants who rushed forward to accuse the Jew, without evidence— shows how information about Jews was synthesized, transformed, and transmitted by individual Christians to result in judicial convictions by seemingly dispassionate government institutions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1002,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23

Examples from several Eastern‐based religions (Divine Light Mission, Hare Krishna, and 3HO) and Western‐based groups (including the Christian World Liberation Front and the Children of God) demonstrate the manner in which former activists converted to groups that utilized radical imagery to advocate patriarchalism along with individual rather than structural transformation.

606,The new social psychology of France: The heritage of Jacques Lacan,"In recent years psychology has taken on a new cenerality in French thought, but the extent and character of this development is not well understood and its religious dimension is generally overlooked. It is misleading to think of Jacques Lacan as a Freudian; his thought is rooted more in that of Hegel (via Kojève) and involves a fundamentally non‐Freudian theory of desire. Freud's focus was biological. For Lacan, as for Kojève, human appetite is oriented more toward the subjectivity of others (in a struggle for recognition between ‘self and ‘other') than toward pleasure or a release of physical tensions. The religious dimension is closely associated with the theme of a possible relation to the other as other and the question of whether recognition is something to be coerced through domination or given in the mode of love. Even without belief in a God, the Law is needed to support sublimation and to teach the love of neighbor. Other Lacanians continue this theme. François Roustang has criticized Lacan for failing to realize the full theoretical import of his own prophetic message about respect for the other, especially with reference to the transference relation and its exploitation in the analytic process. Marie Balmary brings the Lacanian thrust full circle by analyzing the way the Bible itself deals with psychological issues.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1006/reli.1993.1004,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-23

608,"Buying a passport to heaven: Usury, restitution, and the merchants of medieval Genoa","Historians have argued that the ecclesiastic ban on loans at interest delayed the development of capital markets in the middle ages, and have supported this by pointing to well-documented cases of restitutions of usurious gains by famous moneylenders. Strictly, however, such evidence does not prove that usury laws affected lending, because donations by rich bankers may reflect other motivations. If usury laws had an impact, we have to exclude the Medicis or the Fuggers from the sample, and look for it among the small moneylenders of medieval Europe. Data from late medieval Genoa show that donations by merchants were no greater than those of the population at large once personal wealth is accounted for. However, among merchants the value of pious bequests correlates more closely with mercantile activity than personal wealth, a finding that supports the view that usury laws created an effective constraint on medieval capital markets.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2892%2990042-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-22

This line of continuity has its immediate historical origins in the religious forms of Italian rural folk. Those practices were then taken to New Jersey and New York in the closing decades of the 19th century, where they remained in evidence until well into the 20th century. The emotional configuration of the peasant in a traditional society remained as the emotional configuration of the Italian-American worker. The way in which peasants contextualized their theological lives in rural Italy was similar to the way they did so in America, for in the latter, as in the former, class subordination remained a central reality of daily life. Despite that subordination, peasants and workers achieved an air of dignity through the construction of Catholic practices which served to undermine further attempts to implement ideological domination.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2892%2990043-4,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-22

Her article ‘Fascism and religion in Romania’, makes much of certain British Foreign Office documents which I have inspected in detail. Not only do these documents fail to corroborate Berger's conclusions but they cast real doubt on Berger's critical detachment. Her claim that Eliade was detained in England because of his political activities on behalf of the Iron Guard, and also of Nazi Germany, is without foundation. Other insinuations which she has made about Eliade's political motivations are subject to alternative interpretations. Eliade undoubtedly was vehemently nationalist in his youth and gave some support to the Legion of the Archangel Michael.

612,Sharing the flower: A non-supernaturalistic theory of grace,"Questioning the usual understanding of Native American religions as supernaturalistic, this study re-examines the ritual system of the Yaqui people of Arizona. First, it evaluates assumptions about the nature of religion—including God, grace, and prayer—which inform the ethnographical interpretation of Yaqui religion. Second, it reconstructs the Yaqui cosmological system and relates their complex cosmos to the traditional religious actors, the Deer Dancer and the Pascola clowns. Third it examines the master symbol, Sewa or Flower, to demonstrate that Yaqui religious logic does not correspond to the grace theory of Catholicism. Fourth, it demonstrates that flower embodies a causal system in which all religious actors, human and transcendent beings alike, achieve ritual efficacy in mutual, reciprocal acts of witnessing. Finally, the essay observes that ‘conversion’ fails to make sense of Yaqui syncretism for two related reasons. In the first place, the Yaqui neither rejected the world nor embraced a monotheism which assigns a privileged, vertical superiority to God. In the second, the Yaqui applied traditional insights deriving from the most basic realm of myth to reach an understanding that Jesus and Deer are alike powerful innocents who sacrifice themselves so that others might live. In all these ways, the essay demonstrates that the concept of the supernatural fails to explain either the traditional or the Christian sides of Yaqui religion and suggests that the same may be true for other Native American religions as well.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2892%2990017-X,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-22

Following Barbara and Dennis Tedlock, prayer-sticks are understood as forms of symbolic self-sacrifice that redefine an integral self as having cosmic responsibilities for maintaining life.

This essay challenges Hultkrantz's claims through an analysis of the Oglala concept of person. It suggests that the Oglala world view provides a quite different understanding, one which embodies a relational ontology and ethic.

The contemporary Gi-Be Feast (‘Ghost Supper’, or Gi-Be Wiikonge) is historically derived from the 17th-century Feast of the Dead and communicates underlying traditional religious values metaphorically. Metaphors that can be delineated within contemporary Gi-Be Feasts include: Time Is A Changer, Life Is Fluid, Purposes Are Destinations, and Events Are Actions. Sharing creates solidarity because such actions voice the traditional value placed on establishing proper relationships to mediate interpersonal distance and overcome a sense of dangerous otherness. By attributing metaphorical meaning to ritual, the Odawa adapt to changing circumstances by reinforcing ethnic cohesion.

Attention is then paid to the doctrine of rebirth which underpins Buddhist thinking on conception and abortion. Brief mention is also made here of how this doctrine might affect attitudes to contraception, in vitro fertilization and embryo-experimentation.

It argues that the rise to dominance of instrumental systems such as the world economy and global system of states has brought about globalization and the global spread of values like equality and progress. The holistic style of religion prevents it from developing as a parallel instrumental system but also suits it for addressing resultant problems like vast inequalities and environmental degradation. Both of these raise questions of theodicy and the meaning of the whole. We should therefore expect the conjunction of liberal religious concern with social justice and ecological issues. There is, however, also ambiguity as progress towards social justice may contradict preservation of the natural environment.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2892%2990034-2,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-22

Wiebe ends by declaring religious thought generally to be mythopoeic. The anthropological literature does support well Wiebe's thesis that primitive thought is primitive, in particular those studies which use Piaget's theory of cognitive development as a guide for interpreting primitive and other thought styles. But Piaget's theory can be extended to interpret other stages of culture and thought. This aids in recognizing that religious thought develops in stages also, from primitive folktales to archaic complex myths, and then to classical rationalized theologies and most recently to symbolic theologies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2892%2990035-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-22

This paper examines how these ideas are reflected in Śaiva religious practices focused on the body, which intend to realize the body as divine. In this connection Śaiva visionary yoga and the transformation of emotion and instinct are considered.

624,Contemporary Theravāda and Zen Buddhist attitudes to human sexuality: An exercise in comparative ethics,"As in many other religions, the issue of the correct attitude towards human sexual activity reflects the fundamental philosophical standpoints of the various branches of the Buddhist religion. In this article, the Theravāda and Zen schools are examined, both in general terms and through an indepth examination of the opinions which some leading contemporary Buddhist spokesmen of both groups hold on the matter. The Theravādin stance is found to be that sexual activity is something to be ultimately transcended in the attainment of Nibbāna. This tallies with its conception of Nibbāna as fundamentally different from Samsara. As an interim measure, the Theravādins maintain that a harmonious sexual existence is best achieved by observing certain rules which define certain persons as inadmissible sexual partners, and stress the necessity of approaching those who transgress sexually in a compassionate manner. In the Zen tradition, the Mahāyāna non-dualistic concept of Nirvāna as not intrinsically different from Samsāra has led to the acceptance of sexuality as an integral aspect of the religious life, albeit one which needs to be practised within the context of the disciplined Zen life style.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2892%2990037-5,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-22
625,Ambiguous sexuality: Imagery and interpretation in tantric Buddhism,"A critic of the thesis that asceticism and celibacy are central to mysticism might well turn for support to the Buddhist and Hindu tantras, whose practices often are assumed to involve ‘sex in the service of enlightenment’. I will attempt to show that the issue is not nearly so simple, by demonstrating the ambiguity of sexual imagery in Buddhist tantric texts and the historical ambivalence of the tantric tradition itself regarding the place and meaning of sexuality. After presenting three highly encoded ‘performance-songs’ (caryāgīti) of the Indian Buddhist adept Kānha (11th century), I will discuss the nature of interpretation in the tantric tradition, then the various ways in which the sexual imagery in Kānha's performance songs may be read. There appear to be at least four possible levels of interpretation: (1) literal, where sexuality is overt, (2) symbolic, where the surface sexuality is a metaphor for certain meditative achievements, (3) ‘higher’ literal, where the symbolized meditative achievements are actualized by ritual sexuality, and (4) yogic, where sexual rites are revealed to entail sublimation rather than indulgence, asceticism rather than eroticism. By way of conclusion, I will address some possible criticisms of my analysis, and suggest broader comparative issues arising from it.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2892%2990038-6,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-22
626,Studying religion today,"The salience of issues of ‘objectivity’ in the study of religion is presently increasing in the context of enhanced religious conflict, controversy and overt politicization. These issues arise and ramify on various levels: epistemological, ethical, existential and interpersonal. As students of religion are increasingly impelled to ‘become part of their data’, they need to consider whether a value-neutral ‘scientific’ study of religion can remain viable in a period of religious tumult? Feminism, Liberation Theology and concern over the perceived persecution of stigmatized religious minorities (‘cults’) represent three orientations which are currently shaping the sociology of religion in the United States.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2891%2990035-O,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-21
627,The discomfiture of religious experience,"We live in an age where major and minor structured and unstructured cults are mushrooming, most of them aiming at achieving an ecstatic or religious experience. Rather than objective inquiry, reaction to them is often passionate, unreasoning, even vituperous to an extent that seems out of proportion to their relative size of clientele. On the basis of anthropological fieldwork with Apostolic congregations in the U.S.A., Mexico and Yucatán, and as a teacher of a specific technique for achieving religious ecstatic experiences in workshops, I propose to examine some of the cultural and psychological reasons for this abrogation of objectivity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2891%2990036-P,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-21
628,Rational action and uncontrolled violence: Explaining Hindu communalism,"The assertion of Hindu identity in contemporary India takes two characteristic forms: organized movements notable for their effective action; and uncontrolled mob violence. Understanding this apparent paradox entails both general religio-historical explanation and culturally specific interpretation. From a general perspective, organized movements and mob violence each offers a means of identifying with the same religious object—in this case, the Hindu nation, newly valorized in urban India. But the specific relationship between the two can be interpreted through themes of control and violence in Shaivite myth.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2891%2990038-R,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-21

Consequently, the ludicrous should be analysed in a systematic way as part of the religious totality. The comic forms are interesting because they are ludicrous, but they are even more interesting because they have a considerable power to generate meanings. The present article concentrates on structural and phenomenological aspects of the ludicrous in religions. The article (1) Discusses methods and pitfalls in an investigation of the ludicrous in religious texts, (2) Describes the structure of comical incongruities in religion, (3) Interprets the meanings of laughter as an opening up of the human body, and (4) Suggests a connection between the transcending functions of mystical and ludicrous experiences.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2891%2990050-Z,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-21

It shows that canonical texts do not always support such claims, and that the notion of nature itself sits uncomfortably within a Buddhist framework.

Contrary to common belief Sinhala monks do not act as a monolithic body, particularly on political issues.

In recent years she has turned her attention toward developing, in her words, ‘a coherent argument about the social control of cognition’. She argues that religious and other beliefs are ‘part of the action’ in society.

This article surveys expert opinion on Aboriginal religions from the first published account of 1798 up to the present time, considering a procession of presuppositions ranging from the utopian antipodean to the sub-human barbarian; from the noble savage to the unevolved primitive; and from the culture-bound native to the ‘intellectual aristocrat’. Developments in the accumulation of ‘factual’ evidence are considered in the context of theoretical fashions and the history of an interpretative understanding of Aboriginal religious life.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2891%2990061-T,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-21
635,From philosophy to religion,"When we examine the theory of the social order set forth by the successive documents of the canonical writings of Judaism, we find an account of the way of life, world view, and definition of the social entity. But by ‘way of life’ or ‘world view’ one system need not mean exactly the same category of data that another system adopts for itself, and, it goes without saying, we cannot claim functional equivalency, for obvious reasons as irrelevant as the judgment of relativism. A system selects its data to expose its systemic categories; defines its categories in accord with the systemic statement that it wishes to set forth; identifies the urgent question to which the systemic message compellingly responds. In the study of the three stages in the history of the formation of Judaism—philosophical, religious and, finally, theological—we find that the successor-system held up a mirror to the received categories and so redefined matters that everything was reversed, left becoming right, down becoming up, power turned into weakness, things of real value transformed into intangibles. What the successor-thinkers did was not continue and expand the categorical repertoire but set forth a categorically-fresh vision of the social order—a way of life, world view and definition of the social entity—within appropriate counterpart-categories. The formation of Judaism that took place through the transformation of Judaism from an account of the social order that was essentially philosophical to one that was fundamentally religious was accomplished by reversing the flow of language, specifically taking the predicate of a sentence and moving it to the position of the subject, that is, commencing not from subject but from predicate. This transvaluation of values, through not merely the re-formation but the utter transformation of categories, set forth an essentially fresh answer to a fundamentally new urgent question.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2891%2990026-M,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-21

637,The Yogi's human self: Tāyumānavar in the Tamil mystical tradition,"Although the dominant current of Tamil Hinduism is the temple-oriented religion of emotional devotion (bhakti), elements drawn from the classical school of Yoga have always been prominent within the bhakti canon. There is a fertile and dynamic opposition in this conjunction, an opposition arising out of starkly contrasting visions of the world and human goals—since bhakti aims at melting down the empirical personality, a process of ‘liquefaction’ through emotion and sensual openness, whereas Yoga seeks to arrest the flux of normal experience and to transcend emotions and sensory perceptions. The paper first sets out the contours of this opposition and points to its cultural and historical significance.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2891%2990028-O,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-21

Individuals may take personal decisions to become Buddhists, but Christian discourses and forms of life continue to have an observable influence on English Buddhism. The significance of the person is a useful point at which to begin assessing these continuities between English Buddhism and other cultural trends. Such continuities pose theoretical and methodological questions concerning the approach to Buddhism in religious studies. In studying its development in England ‘Buddhism’ becomes a problematic category for the analyst, rather than a label for a readily identifiable phenomenon of eastern origin which has merely been transferred into a western context.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2891%2990029-P,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-21

Through these connections, North American Christianity is having considerable influence on a large segment of African Christianity. This article outlines one US development called ‘The Gospel of Prosperity’, and examines its spread to Africa.

641,Religious healing in 19th century ‘new religions’: The cases of Tenrikyo and christian science,"Religious healing has played a major role in the origin and growth of new indigenous religious movements in both Japan and America. The plethora of new religious movements can be traced in both instances to the 19th century. Japan's Tenrikyo movement and America's Christian Science movement provide two fascinating case studies of the experience of religious healing in recent times. Both have grown into international religious movements claiming millions of adherents. Both have spawned a number of branch movements which follow essentially the same practices as the parent groups, but which have splintered off for political or doctrinal reasons. Both are very evident in the political and economic fabrics of their respective societies. Most important for the purposes of this paper, both began with remarkable healing experiences, and continue to treat healing at the heart of their theologies. This paper will compare these religions on a number of counts, concluding with some observations more applicable to religious healing in general. These healing religions lend themselves to ready comparison along the lines of their respective social histories, theologies and healing techniques. By a comparison of their differences of style and content, we may also suggest some preliminary conclusions about the nature of religious healing and its connection to religious doctrine.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2890%2990165-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-20

Modern dictionaries and commentators explain or translate the term variously as ‘threat’, ‘menace’, ‘ruin’, ‘destruction’ or ‘poisonous’. Some even try to emend the word(s) in order to make the verse more intelligible. Yet, contrary to the current explanation, a thorough linguistic analysis will show that hwt (sg)/hwwt (pl) in these verses, and in others as well, should be understood as ‘word(s)’ and in the derived meanings of ‘thought(s)’ or ‘incantations(s)’.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2890%2990166-4,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-20

653,The embodied text: Covenant and Torah,"Whilst body-metaphors play a major part in the self-understanding of many religious traditions and such metaphorical themes are found in Judaism, there is a dominant Jewish tradition which links the human body with the text of the Torah. This article examines the correspondences drawn in rabbinic literature between body and the Torah-text, concentrating on the tradition of the identification of the component parts of the human body with the component parts of the Torah (as the 613 mitzvot or commandments). This identification is explored both in terms of its development and the way in which it read back into earlier rabbinic sources. It is contended that this tradition is more adequately understood as a significant element in the history of Jewish self-understanding rather than as a series of ‘homelitical flourishes’—for example, the perfection of the body is linked to the perfection of the Torah by the observance of the commandments. The biological and cultural continuity of Israel, it is argued, has been in part assured by this particular understanding of the relationship between body and Torah, as the invidividual Jew becomes incorporated into the ‘body’ of Israel by becoming an ‘embodied text’. This textual embodiment has been one of the principal strategies of Jewish survival as the natural body is overcome and the cultural/textual body created anew in each generation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2890%2990029-6,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-20

It is the contention of this article that the adaption of a ‘millenarian’ model may grant us new insight into the dynamics of the movement's origin, especially in addressing those questions that ask why the movement began when it did, and what was its purpose in calling Christians to accept the new authority of the Paraclete as revealed through Montanus and his prophetesses.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990050-X,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19

Even when ‘diffusionism’, ‘patternism’, and an apparent preoccupation with rituals presumed sexual are all factored out, modern scholars offer little new because they appeal to rituals never witnessed and to fragmentary texts which we can only hope had some connection to ritual. Focusing on an extant ritual tradition in India with a 200-year-old festival and an explicitly associated text from the 13th century ce, Harman suggests that here, at least, sacred marriage is an elaborate, ritual statement of kinship responsibilities and obligations reestablished each year among deities and between deities and selected human beings.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990051-1,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
656,Charisma and the production of messages on Tanna (Vanuatu),"This paper draws upon Foucault's analysis of ‘orders of discourse’ to explore why ‘charisma’—or legitimate authority based upon the production of valuable messages—is rarely institutionalized in Melanesia. A discursive emphasis on inspiration, devaluation of authorial creativity, and other conditions ensure that individual prophets lose control of their messages and their authoritative sources. As such, Melanesian charisma is depersonalized and difficult to routinize or transform into other kinds of authority. Example messages are drawn from Tanna's John Frum movement.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990052-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
657,The body in Buddhist and Hindu Tantra: Some notes,"The Buddhist and Hindu Tantras employ a non-dualist conceptualization of body and mind based upon the anatomy of the ‘subtle body’ with its ‘centres’ (cakra), ‘channels’ (nādī) and flows of ‘energy’ (prāna) and differing greatly from conventional Western modes of thinking about body and mind. The Buddhist Tantras add the central concept of bodhicitta, which is conceived of as both a motivational state and a pattern of energy-distribution within the ‘subtle body’. The Tantric terminology forms part of a set of techniques for learning new modes of operating with the human nervous system and thus the body-mind totality. The social and cultural implications of such techniques, and more specifically of the Tantric sexual practices, are examined for both India and Tibet. It is suggested that transformation in ‘consciousness’ and transformations in ‘society’ such as those connected with the Tantras should be see as aspects of a single process, neither reducible to the other. The Tantric lineages preserve centuries of experience in the use of alternate states of consciousness and body-mind techniques within complex literate cultures. As Western interest in such processes grows, the Tantras provide an obvious resource, but if we are to learn from them we need also to consider them in relation to their original social and cultural milieu.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990019-5,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
658,Aspects of the interrelationship of divine and human bodies in Hinduism,"This paper shows the wide significance of the body within Hinduism. The divine in Hinduism is pre-eminently viewed in bodily terms and in bodies that vary greatly. Visu, Śiva, and the Goddess are viewed in detail. By way of conclusion, a striking instance of the corporeal nature of temple images, the wooden images of the Jagannāth temple at Puri, is considered.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990020-1,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
659,Offering the body: The practice of gCod in Tibetan Buddhism,"The use of the body as a vehicle for spiritual transformation as exemplified in the Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice known as gCod (‘cutting’) is discussed. The principal feature of this form of meditation is its stress on the contemplative offering of the body as a technique for generating the compassion and wisdom crucial to the attainment of buddhahood according to Mahāyāna Buddhism. In the first part of this paper a brief definition of the principal features of gCod is given, and then the practice is situated in its historical setting by relating its development as a distinct practice in the eleventh century and briefly surveying its subsequent transmission. This introductory material will be followed by a discussion of the theoretical underpinning of gCod, as located primarily in the confluence of the Prajñāparamitā doctrines and the techniques of the Vajrayāna. The third and final part of the paper focuses on one particular example of a gCod meditation-text, outlining the fundamental structure of the practice, and at the same time endeavours to show how it is designed to provide existential realisation of the various doctrinal affirmations of Mahāyāna Buddhism.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990021-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
660,The body and the boundaries of Zoroastrian spirituality,"In this paper I offer some introductory reflections on the body in the structure of Zoroastrian thought, based upon the evidence of Avestan and Middle Persian sources. In Zoroastrianism the forces of good and evil in the world are regarded as palpable and actual: the good, divine creation is spiritually conceived and physically embodied, and, without any sense of ‘materialism’, the physical elements are held as sacred; evil is, so to speak, the anti-body, since it has of itself no physical, only a parasitic, destructive presence in the world. The physical, ethical, social, environmental and spiritual domains of existence are strictly delineated, and a pattern seems to emerge from the texts. Sociological thinking has recently sought to explain such drawing of boundaries with regard to the body and society, and to this the very distinctive evidence of the old Iranian tradition should be added.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990022-5,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19

University of Lancaster, 1983. The paper examines the psycho-physical implications of a traditional Chinese martial art. It focuses on how the art and its training methods entail a non-dualistic understanding of body and mind, and emphasises the importance of bodily felt awareness. The roles of Taoism and Buddhism in association with traditional Chinese martial arts are considered as they contributed to this developing non-dualistic understanding. The paper briefly examines the notions of bodily awareness in the work of M. Merleau-Ponty and D. M. Levin and concludes with a brief consideration of the possible educational, ethical and social implications of the practice of traditional martial arts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990023-7,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19

Drawing attention to the eastern orthodox form of Christianity as the background of Eliade's thinking, the article expresses doubts concerning Eliade's influence.

665,The secret nostalgia of Mircea Eliade for paradise: Observations on the method of the ‘history of religions’,"Mircea Eliade uses in his analyses of the history of religions a complex methodology called by him ‘creative hermeneutics’. This methodology has benefited from the suggestions of numerous modern authors (including R. Otto, C. J. Jung, S. Dasgupta) and from theoretical elements in various disciplines. The fundamental principle of interpretation behind Eliade's science of religion methodology has hitherto remained hidden.

Its relationship with the Purusamedha is examined, and it is proposed that the latter was no mere ‘theoretical rite’ as widely supposed, but predated the former, and was transformed into it following the Āryan settlement in India, as a second function adaptation of a first function rite appropriate to military expansion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990073-0,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
668,Women as aspects of the mother Goddess in India: A case study of Ramakrishna,"In India the worship of the Goddess as Mother is often linked with the recognition of all women as in some ways embodiments of the Mother. This is in turn taken as ascribing a high view of women themselves. In this paper I wish to question this latter assumption, taking as a case study Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a famous nineteenth century Benali ‘saint and mystic’, well known for his devotion to the Goddess and his teaching that devotees should regard all women as Mother. This questioning is based on the record of his teaching in the śrī śrī rāmakrisna kathāmrita, and on published material on India sexual psychology, and concludes that Ramakrishna did not, in fact, demonstrate a high view on women.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990074-2,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19

These years were also a time of major cultural upheaval for the Jewish community of Palestine. The author suggests that an increase in pilgrimage to shrines of saints can be seen as an attempt to make sense out of current reality by linking it to sacred history. An important impetus for the development of a pilgrimage site may be the perceived convergence of aspects of the saint's biography with current political and social conditions.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990075-4,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
670,William Robertson Smith and the study of religion,"This article discusses William Robertson Smith's significance to the study of religion in the light of some important themes in his Lectures on the Religion of the Semites. Although rooted in an evolutionist frame of understanding which in Robertson Smith's case represented a particular theological variation, this work pointed forward to the functionalist theory of religion as a social phenomenon. Robertson Smith's theory of sacrifice as a communion has been abandoned for more than half a century, but it is interesting in the way it draws upon the major, yet controversial source to early Semitic sacrifice, the Narratio ascribed to Nilus. The reasons for the contemporary view of the Narratio as an unreliable source are reviewed, and it is shown that Robertson Smith's use of the Narratio reflects his own preassumed model of religion. Robertson Smith does not stand alone with this model. On the contrary, the conformation of the Narratio of both past and present prejudices explains its popularity as a ‘source’ in the history of religions. A review of Robertson Smith's work and influence concludes that his significance is not so much due to specific achievements in the study of religion, but rather to his intuitive ability to grasp essential elements of religion.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990076-6,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
671,The Baha'i faith 1957–1988: A survey of contemporary developments,"This paper gives a general account of the developments in the Baha'i Faith over the last three decades. The period began with the Baha'i Faith as a little-known religion with a hereditary leadership of predominantly Iranian membership but with some spread to the West. At the present time the religion has been transformed into a much better-known religion led by an elected council. It has increased some 20-fold in numbers and is now world-wide in membership. The major structural changes involved as the previous hereditary leadership at the international level was converted into the leadership of an elected council are analysed. The growth and development of the religion over this period are described and some statistical information is given. The central concerns of the religion during this time are described in terms of a number of motifs: polar, legalism, millenarianism, social reformism, universalism, liberalism, and martyrdom and sacrifice. An attempt is made to analyse some of the present problems facing the Baha'i community, both in terms of the persecutions that it suffers as well as the problems presented by its successful expansion, and to describe the ways in which it copes with these.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2889%2990077-8,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-19
672,Verbal craft and religious act in the Iliad: The dynamics of a communal centre,"The collocation of elements at the centre of the Achaian camp in the Iliad-the agori, themis, and the altars-presents a challenge to current ways of thinking about religious communal centres. Cosmological symbolism (Mircea Eliade) and the attempt to embody cosmo-magical power (Paul Wheatley) do not account for the characteristics of this centre. Examination of the activities associated with the elements at the centre of the camp, in contrast with similar activities in a society where cosmological symbolism is prevalent, suggests that the Achaian nmp is structured by a different sort of power, a power that is not cosmomagical, but strictly social.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980044-7,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
673,The hermeneutics of visionary experience: Revelation and interpretation in the Zohar,"This paper analyses the processes of revelation and interpretation as they function in the classic work of medeival Jewish mysticism, the Zohar. The author points out that visionary experience ofthe divine is not only central to Zoharic theosophy, but that the act of textual study itself must be understood in the light of this phenomenon insofar as the text is nothing but the configuration of divine light. The author demonstrates that the phenomenological structure of these two modes is identical according to the Zohar. Hence, the kabbalist who interprets Scripture attains the level of Moses who received the Torah at Sinai.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980046-0,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18

He further claimed that the da y after his vision he found the Book of Mormon plates. An analysis of Smith's vision narratives-the earliest of which dates to 1832-shows that such claims were anachronistic. Smith could not have found the plates that year. Possibly Smith invented the vision in order to gain status in his family; more probably, however, there was a vision (hallucination) which Smith interpreted differently as time passed and he saw its significance for his career as prophet and ' translator'.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980047-2,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
675,‘Coxey's Army’ as a millennial movement,"'Coxey's Army' was the popular name for a march of unemployed workers which left Massillon, Ohio, on Easter Sunday 1894, and arrived in Washington, D.C., on May Day. It was the first nationally reported protest march on Washington and as an example of protest against economic conditions is usually classified as a form of Populism. Careful analysis, however, reveals that it possessed important religious elements, specifically an idiosyncratic millennialism. Its millennialism was compounded of three elements: (I) a premillennial view of history; (2) Populist conspiracy theory, identifying Jewish bankers as the cause of economic problems; and (3) a vulgarized beliefin reincarnation, according to which all souls were deemed to include a fraction of the reincarnated soul of Jesus. Notwithstanding its doctrinal peculiarities, 'Coxey's Army' resembles many of the syncretic millenarian movements of the 1970s and '80s, with its fusion of fundamentalist doctrine, political radicalism, and Asian-occult elements.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980048-4,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
676,The functions of religion: A reappraisal,"The loss by religion in the West of its social functions is seen as the circumstance that has permitted social, political, and economic agencies to reduce and abandon their support of Christianity. Toleration of different denominations by the state (and ecumenism in the churches) is taken to have become possible as religion was extruded from the institutional framework of society. Once its erstwhile latent fimctions were appropriated and rationalized by specialized agencies outside the religious sphere, religion was liberated from its role of providing support for secular authorities, and acquired unwittingly a new ideological independence and the potential capacity for social criticism. However, since religion has become so largely privatized, the churches suffer from uncertainty of social purpose. The functions of religion have become largely explicit and increasingly personal, hence religion has become a matter of individual choice among a variety of promised and mainly this-worldly benefits. New religious bodies adapt better to this situation than do traditional churches, but what they offer is not always regarded as functional either for individuals or society by governments and by the mass media, and the eligibility of these bodies for charitable status and tax concessions is often challenged. It is recognized that when religion becomes a matter of personal choice rather than of institutional presence, sociologists may increasingly favour survey techniques for its study. The vestigial persistence t)f some of the older functions of religon is recognized, but it is argued that these have become curiously transmuted.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980025-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
677,Asking questions about religious experience,"Research evidence in both Britain and the United States over the past 15 years suggests that reports of 'religious experience' are much more widespread than was previously suspected. The concept of 'religious experience' has its origins in Protestant Christianity, but has come to refer to a realm of experience believed by some scholars to be common to all members of the species. It would seem that recent proposals to make comparative investigations of religious experience across a number of different religious cultures require an assumption of the validity of the 'common core' view. Some of the difficulties involved in this assumption are discussed, and suggestions made for a continuing research programme.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980026-5,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
678,Personal religious belief development: The ‘Articulate authoritarian’ type,"With religious experience or ritual, believing is one of several universal modes through which humans cultivate a relationship to the divine. Treating belief as an avenue of spiritual development, this study describes how in some lives, religious beliefs become clear, elaborate, and functional. Data from two rural counties in Georgia show fundamentalists to be the most vigorous local religious thinkers, suggesting an 'articulate authoritarian' style of belief cultivation. The coincidence in a personality of devotion to an absolute spiritual authority with analytic capability, can generate beliefs that are highly dogmatic and conceptually refined. The biographies of four rural Protestants illustrate; two cross-cultural exemplars are suggested.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980027-7,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
679,Experience/narrative structure/reading: Patty hearst and the American Indian captivity narratives,"The Patty Hearst story provides an excellent opportunity to study how an historical occurrence with elements of a classical initiatory scenario generates different narratives and readings. It also is of cultural and historical significance insofar as the criminal trial provided the venue for a public contest of competing understandings of the self or identity and moral responsibility. The Hearst case demonstrated that modern American culture lacks an adequate interpretive paradigm to deal with identity transformation. I argue that the corpus of American Indian captivity narratives provide numerous historical parallels to this case which, coupled with the contributions of the history of religions to our understanding of initiatory ordeals and rituals, can help us to decipher the deeper significance of the Patty Hearst story.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980028-9,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18

He continues and refines some insights and terminology of Max Weber, speaking of the 'outworldly individual' of 'world-renouncing' asceticism and monasticism. A comparison of Christian and (Theravfi.da) Buddhist monasticism shows the centrality of celibacy (= being unmarried) in the cross-cultural sociological perception ofwhat it is to be a monk. The monk expresses his essentially individual nature in the virtue of self-sufficiency, and his social existence in that of friendship. The concluding section suggests that the 'ideal society' of monastic individuals has provided--in the western tradition of social and political thought, but not in the Buddhist and Indian--a paradigm for thought about society as a whole, and that this is the way in which monastic individualism has affected modern thought.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980007-1,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
681,Postulations for safeguarding preconceptions: The case of the scientific religionist,"The study of religion in the academic/university setting has increasingly come under the influence of theology. It is argued here that retheologizing of the 'discipline' lacks any sound methodological warrants, but is grounded instead on a concern for safeguarding certain religious preconceptions (i.e. about Religion/religions). It is suggested, therefore, that retheologizing Religious Studies appears no less problematic in this context than does the retheologizing of biology which has provided us with 'scientific creationism'. Insofar as this essay argues that the philosophy of religion ought to be as much concerned with issues such as these as with the substantive beliefs/doctrines of religions, it contributes to the rejuvenation of that 'discipline'.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980015-0,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
682,The theological enemies of religious studies,"The academic study of religion faces enemies on two fronts: secular and theological. The two come together on a single proposition. It is that religion is personal and private, not social, not an issue of culture, politics, public interest. What people do when they study religion, therefore, is to analyze an interior world, a world with little bearing on the realities of public discourse. Accordingly, no reason tells us why we should study religion, because, as a private and personal matter, there is something to be reported and recorded, but not studied. The study of religion, within tiffs theology, does not involve knowledge of the world, but only of the individual at the most unique and unrepresentative. Religion, the totality of private messages, does not make itself available for study and analysis, for communication in public discourse. Within the theological theory of the matter, there is slight basis for academic study, for there is nothing to know, only something to report for the appreciation and edification of others. The accumulated messages of God's communication to individuals, one by one and in an intensely personal way, of course impress the secular enemies of religious studies as nonsense. The world presents more important subjects for study than nonsense. So, for its own reasons, the secular side concurs that religion is intensely personal. Religion is something not public, therefore not a matter of knowledge. Theological and secular enemies of religious studies therefore trivialize religion. That is how theological and secular enemies of religious studies treat religion as something essentially beyond all social analysis, irrelevant to the formation of culture and the study of society. The consequences of that view for the academic study of religion are spelled out.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980016-2,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18

In this paper, I demonstrate that the 'ascension myth' and the 'Lucifer myth' are positive and negative variants of the same story. I explore the possibility that this story may reflect the social world of its narrators. However, I find the ultimate source of its power in generational conflicts within individual families, perceived from opposite viewpoints, and projected into the heavens.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980018-6,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
685,"Maimonides, imagination and the objectivity of prophecy","In linking prophecy so closely to imagination, Maimonides is frequently understood to be undermining the objectivity of prophecy. He is critical of the literal truth of prophetic accounts, and tends to regard prophecy as a natural phenomenon, related to dreaming. Through a discussion of his use of Aristotle's concept of phantasia it can be seen that he tries to hold on to both the objectivity of prophecy and its imaginative nature. He manages to do this by stressing the objectivity of the logical relationship between the prophetic image and the point it is designed to make.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S0048-721X%2888%2980019-8,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-18
686,Jung and Gnosticism,"Carl Jung interprets Gnosticism the way he interprets alchemy: as a hoary counterpart to his analytical psychology. As interpreted by Jung, Gnostic myths describe a seemingly outward, if also inward, process which is in fact an entirely inward, psychological one. The Gnostic progression from sheer bodily existence to the rediscovery of the immaterial spark trapped in the body and the reunion of that spark with the immaterial godhead symbolize the Jungian progression from sheer ego consciousness to the rediscovery of the unconscious within the mind and the integration of the ego with the unconscious to forge the self. For Jung, Gnostics are the ancient counterpart to present-day Jungian patients. Both constitute a psychological elite. Where most persons are satisfied with traditional means of connecting themselves to their unconscious, Gnostics and Jungians are sensi tive to the demise of those means and are seeking new ones. Where, alternatively, most other persons are oblivious to the existence of the unconscious altogether, Gnostics and Jungians are preoccupied with it. Gnostics project their unconscious onto the cosmos and are therefore striving to connect themselves to something external, not just, like Jungians, to something internal. Interpreting in Jungian terms the Gnostic myth Poimandres, I argue that Jungian psychology makes enormous sense of the myth, but not in the way that Jung envisions. Upon rediscovering his spark, the Gnostic seeks to reject his body altogether rather than to mesh the two. He does strive to reunite with the godhead, but the godhead is immateriality itself rather than, like the body, matter. Indeed, the godhead, taken psychologically, is only a projection of the unconscious onto the cosmos, so that the unconscious is thereby reuniting with itself. The Gnostic's uncompromising rejection of the body and, more, of the whole material world therefore symbolizes not, as Jung assumes, the Jungian ideal of wholeness but the Jungian nemesis of inflation or, worse, psychosis.

The most striking characteristic of this symbol is that its qualities and functions are determined more by anthropology than by botany. In Gnostic religion the physiological processes of human fertilization and gestation are used as metaphors for the process of making a spiritual man. The Tree is life-giving, and can be perceived as being either female or male. In the latter case, the male generative Tree is opposed by a female Tree of death. The symbol of the Tree is applied both in Christian Gnostic systems and in systems which are not Christianized. The Tree can be personalized and may be associated either with Jesus or with Eve. In the Conclusion, the problem of the Tree as a universal symbol is discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2887%2990058-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-17
688,‘Fundamentalism’ Christian and Islamic,"This article seeks to answer the question whether the term ‘fundamentalism’ is an appropriate label for certain Islamic movements by undertaking a detailed comparison with Protestant Christian fundamentalism, for which the term was originally coined. After an effort to identify and characterize the two phenomena, a number of similarities and differences are discussed. Among the differences is the fact that the most obvious defining characteristics in each case (Biblical inerrancy for Protestants and politicalsocial involvement for Muslims) are of little relevance to the other case. Among the similarities is a common opposition to ‘modernism’ and a tendency to stress what has been distinctive to the Protestant and Islamic traditions, respectively. The conclusion is that, while the two phenomena do have much in common, ‘fundamentalism’ is not an appropriate common label. The author prefers ‘Islamic radicalism’ for the Muslim case and tentatively suggests ‘radical neotraditionalism’ as a common label.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2887%2990059-5,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-17
689,Seventeenth-Century English millenarianism,"This essay, which is not a review of recent scholarship, offers an overview of 17th-century English Protestant (especially Puritan) millenarianism. Its major point is that English millenarianism was above all else a pre-modern species of historiography. The essay begins with a discussion of the so-called last things, the historiographical categories through which Puritans made history intelligible. It then presents some case studies, in order to show how representative millenarians construed certain last things: the millennium, the Second Coming, the destruction of Antichrist, the conversion of the Jews and the conversion of the Gentiles, and the wrath of Satan. The essay concludes with a consideration of the last days, the time-span in which the last things unfolded.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2887%2990060-1,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-17
690,Burial ‘ad sanctos’ and the physical presence of the Buddha in early Indian Buddhism,"This paper is an attempt to look at Indian Buddhism ‘on the ground’ and is an exercise in what might be called ‘the archeology of religions’. It focuses on one distinct aspect of Buddhist sacred sites in India: the fact that stūpas housing the physical remains of the Buddha or marking a spot where the Buddha was thought formerly to have been present are frequently surrounded by large numbers of smaller secondary stūpas. It attempts to show that these secondary stūpas have mortuary associations and suggests the resulting pattern parallels what is known in the Medieval West as burial ad sanctos. It then attempts—through known archeological parallels, inscriptions, and literary sources—to give meaning to this pattern and suggests that, in spite of doctrinal statements to the contrary, the historical Buddha remained a living presence in the midst of Indian Buddhist communities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2887%2990116-3,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-17
691,On references to the transcendent in the scientific study of religion: A qualified idealist proposal,This paper argues the philosophical and methodological feasibility of using the concept of ‘references to the transcendent’ to formally demarcate religious studies and circumvent the stumbling block of reductionism. There are three steps to the argument: (1) surveying the linguistic twist given to the problems of reductionism by recent developments in the philosophy of science; (2) delineating the new and more forceful case made for a ‘hard reductionist’ framework based on the epistemological insights of Ernest Gellner; (3) criticizing this hard reductionist framework through an extension of the epistemological speculations of Martin Hollis to the social scientific treatment of religious references to the transcendent.,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2887%2990117-5,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-17
692,Psychological and mystical interpretations of early Quakerism: William James and Rufus Jones,"William James' discussion of early Quakerism profoundly affected subsequent interpretations of the group by the prominent scholar and Quaker writer, Rufus Jones. Jones utilized James as a major exponent of the divine origins of George Fox's doctrinal beliefs and social protests. The major claims of James and Jones, however, are not sustained by more recent critical scholarship on Quakerism's early days. By examining and refuting these claims, this article argues that interpretations of Quakerism (and by extension, of other religious collectivities) should be based primarily upon historically grounded, social-psychological frameworks.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2887%2990118-7,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-17
693,"Protestantism, authoritarianism and democracy: A comparison of The Netherlands, The United States and South Africa","Protestantism took on a similar Calvinist cast among ascendent Dutch during the Reformation to the Puritans in America, and the Afrikaners in South Africa. These three societies, however, developed very different political systems. The social and historical reasons for these differences are traced. Elements in Protestantism that could potentially lead to different forms of liberal democracy on the one hand, or to authoritarianism on the other, are explored. The different patterns of secularization, or lack thereof, are also delineated in each of the cases.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2887%2990119-9,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-17
694,"Prophetic criticism, incarnational optimism: On recovering the late Kierkegaard","Actually the revolution is much closer than we think. The last band of free thinkers (Feuerbach and all related to him) has attacked or tackled the matter far more clearly than formerly, for if you look more closely, you will see that they actually have taken upon themselves the task of defending Christianity against contemporary Christians. The point is that established Christendom is demoralized, in the profoundest sense all respect for Christianity's existential commitments has been lost … Now Feuerbach is saying: No, wait a minute—if you are going to be allowed to go on living as you are living, then you also have to admit that you are not Christians … it is wrong of established Christendom to say that Feuerbach is attacking Christianity; it is not true, he is attacking the Christians by demonstrating that their lives do not correspond to the teachings of Christianity … What Christianity needs for certain is traitors … (JP 6523)",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2883%2990035-0,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-13
695,"Body-symbols and social reality: Resurrection, incarnation and asceticism in early Christianity","Mary Douglas has invited historians of religion to test her hypothesis about the social meaning of body symbols. Her view that body symbolism always points in the direction of social concerns and that efforts to separate body and spirit indicate sentiments of revolt and alienation has proved fruitful in several areas. Of course there is nothing particularly novel in the proposal that the body can be seen as a symbol of wider realities. The Stoics spoke of the universe as a body; Paul could describe individual Christian congregations as a body; and Priscillian referred to the human body in depreciating terms as a figura mundi. Victor Turner has shown that the body symbols of the Ndembu in Zambia are part of a wider pattern which uses ‘an aspect of human physiology as a model for social, cosmic and religious ideas and processes’, including, he adds, ‘the human body [as] … a microcosm of the universe,’57 There is even a considerable literature on the subject.58 Indeed, one cannot help but be struck by the fact that with the great abundance of work devoted to body symbols in general, so little has been done with early Christianity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2882%2990054-9,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-12
696,Are psychological studies of religion on the right track?,"Researchers in psychology of religion in America and Britain have inherited the theoretical and research traditions established by W. James, S. Freud and J. Dittes. New nomothetic or theoretical frameworks have been called for in order to organize a plethora of idiographic data. A response to the call has been slow, but Paul Pruyser designated at least six areas in which the development of psychology of religion might most fruitfully occur; and the suggestion has been that altered states of consciousness research is perhaps the most important item of all six to consider for research methodology. This particular item, it was broadly suggested, may possibly serve as a bridge between East and West, thereby bringing psychologists of religion out of the darkness of Western methodological ethnocentrism, and into the light of cross-cultural, universally-applicable concerns sought in the spirit of the scientific study of religion. Psychologists of religion must rely on the tradition of Religion-swissenschaft for much of the ‘non-reducible’ data they study. Although the preponderence of general activity in the field is occurring in America, little attention along these lines is evident there. In Britain, the discipline is floundering. Yet, in spite of its quandaries, recognition of the need to encounter Eastern psychologies and religions, perhaps by means of the ‘bridge’ of altered states of consciousness research, appears to be more clearly stated in Britain (though infrequent, often obscure) than it has been elsewhere.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2882%2990005-7,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-12
697,The Ismaili sect in London: Religious institutions and social change,"The Ismailis in London are a community attempting to adapt the stock of Ismaili theoretical concepts to the explanation and control of events in a changed and changing social situation. This article is concerned with assessing the role of Ismaili religious institutions in this process of adaptation. It will be argued that because the Ismaili belief system emphasizes the irrelevant and transitory nature of Ismaili religious institutions, the true role, paradoxically, of these religious institutions is preserved, and as a consequence they remain relevant to Ismailis.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0048-721X%2878%2990032-5,https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrel20?treeId=vrrel20-8
698,Dialogue and faith,"‘Dialogue’ between members of differing traditions is nowadays replacing polemics, debate, and monologue preaching of traditional missionary policy. Terms in which it can be conducted have not yet, however, been widely found. It will be illuminating to discover whether among diverse groups conversation in the terms propounded here could prove fruitful, or at least mutually intelligible. This will be a highly significant test of the theory, expecially in view of the possible importance of this activity for the world's future religious development.1 W.
