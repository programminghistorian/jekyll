## Lesson Proposal for Programming Historian (English edition)

_Programming Historian_ in English is inviting proposals for new lessons.

We encourage prospective authors to think carefully about how their proposal could enhance our learning offer.

You can [explore our journal](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/) to discover what’s already available and consider what you might be able to add.

If the method or approach you’re interested in writing a lesson about is already represented by the [Spanish](https://programminghistorian.org/es/lecciones/), [French](https://programminghistorian.org/fr/lecons/), or [Portuguese](https://programminghistorian.org/pt/licoes/) editions of _Programming Historian_, we welcome proposals to translate those existing, original lessons into English.
