What is Brexit?
'It is the only way out of the trap.'
The Brexit Secretary and Number 10 sources have been warning that the deal is now 'a dead deal for the EU'.
He warned that a 'hard Brexit' would be the end of the road' for the UK.
Ahead of a summit of the EU's heads, the Northern Ireland Secretary said the agreement 'does not offer any detail about the UK's EU exit from the EU in the absence of a breakthrough'.
The DUP is in the government's internal strife over Brexit - with Mr Varardkar demanding a 'credible plan' for Britain leaving the EU without a deal.
The DUP will back the deal as it is, with no deal preparations for a no-deal exit.
Mr Varardkar has suggested that it would be better for Northern Ireland to stay in the Customs Union and single market.
A No10 source said it would be better to back the deal as it would keep open the border between the Republic and the Republic in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
'However, it may be the case that Northern Ireland must stay in the Customs Union and Customs Union to

The European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, has also said it would be seeking to block a no-deal Brexit, or in effect staying in the EU without a say in the negotiations.
Mr Rees-Mogg has said the UK would be leaving the EU on March 29. “We must respect our European Union and continue to defend our interests and our Union.”
The European Research Group of chairs chairs chairman Steve Baker has said the EU would have to wait until after the end of the month to finalise.
He told The Guardian: “The European Union may have to give the UK an extension to Brexit.
“I don’t think there’s much evidence of an extension that it would be feasible.”
They are expected to discuss the EU Withdrawal Bill in Brussels on Wednesday.
They said they would table the bill before it was debated – before deciding whether a no-deal Brexit would be necessary. “I don’t have a clue what the EU would do.”
They are holding talks with Michel Barnier and Donald Tusk, who is part of a European commission with

What is Brexit?
Well, it is a reasonable answer to the question that is not quite the same as the one that is offered by the EU. But if you can see the European Union, you can see the British people who are not only themselves as being ignorant racists.
There is a lot of evidence that this is the case. There are some things that are that are deeply saddening about the UK’s attitude to Brexit.
The problem is that the EU is not at the moment a country that is at war. I know it is not my fault that the EU is not in war. And I know that Brexit is not about Brexit, it is about the EU.
There are many things that do not damage to the EU. The UK’s Brexiters are also undermining the spirit of the European Union.
There is an essential paradox that the EU has been so keen to see Britain as the world’s second-big trading nation, rather than the UK that it is in the single market. The EU has failed to do that.
We have to make the British people look at the world’s economic institutions and economic policies. That’s why we need to make these

What is Brexit?
The backstop is an insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and preserve the Good Friday Agreement.
It is an insurance policy to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
The backstop is also a temporary solution to the backstop.
The UK will be forced to obey all the rules and make no difference between it and the rest of the UK.
However, this would prevent the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
Under the backstop, Northern Ireland would have to apply the same customs code as the rest of the UK.
That is effectively a fall back position.
A no-deal exit would be a fall back position.
However, it is unlikely the backstop will be used.
This would mean Northern Ireland would have to obey all EU laws and regulations.
If there is no backstop, then the UK would be forced into a customs union with the EU, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the Customs Union and would have to follow EU customs rules.
The backstop is a fall back position designed to prevent the return of a hard border in Ireland - but would prevent the

What is Brexit?
A deal dead on the table.
It is now a third meaningful vote on any final agreement on the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The prime minister's spokesman said that if the deal is rejected, the House of Commons has "nothing to learn" from this.
But he added that the government had "nothing to learn" from the "divorce bill" to ensure the UK would continue to follow the EU's rules.
Mr Johnson's spokesman said: "It is the government's position on the negotiations that was given to the House of Commons earlier this year that it would be prepared to consider the issue of border checks, in the event that we can't achieve a trade deal on the island of Ireland, then there is no agreement on the future relationship."
But he added that this would be a "significant step forward" to the UK's future relationship with the EU.
He added: "It is a significant step forward to a meaningful vote on the UK's withdrawal agreement, and the House will have to decide whether it should be ratified.
"There is no way that the House of Commons can be persuaded to do this.
"The House of Commons has indicated that there should


# "Theresa May is"

Theresa May is a tough and unflinching politician who has tried to keep the UK in the Single Market, and whose goods are shipped across the Irish Sea to the Irish Sea, has the numbers to make it work.
The DUP has vowed to back the deal, and said the deal will not be renegotiated, and they will not support the deal.
The DUP has said it is open to MPs to reject the deal.
The DUP has vowed to back the deal, but the PM is facing pressure from MPs to force her to ditch her Brexit deal and go back to Brussels for approval.
Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had been prepared to compromise and the UK would have to "stop and reset its hand" if it would not get a "backstop" to prevent a hard Irish border.
"I don't think we should support the deal, and if the prime minister has got a deal then she will have to do everything she has said she needs to do," he said.
"I am afraid the deal will not be renegotiated, and I am absolutely convinced there will be compromises and compromises."
Meanwhile, the DUP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the DUP's Brexit policy would be

Theresa May is a passionate, pragmatic politician and a committed politician who has been listening to the concerns of many in her party, and whose support has been building in recent weeks.
But when I asked her Cabinet to find a consensus, she replied: "I'm absolutely certain we will never do it."
And she later tweeted: "We will not take a decision on this issue, because we will not discuss the issue of the Irish border.
"We will not discuss the Northern Ireland border in a way that would protect the integrity of the United Kingdom."
But she insisted that "all options on the table" on the table would be avoided, and that she would not discuss the exact exact detail of the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Asked if she would not "deliver Brexit without a backstop" if she was forced to choose, she replied: "I am not sure."
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Brexit strategy has been pushing for a "hard border" to be avoided, and has suggested a return to a hard border in Northern Ireland, the Irish border remains unresolved, and the border remains unresolved, in the Irish Sea.
But in a sign of the EU's

Theresa May is a passionate advocate of the people’s future.
She has a reputation for being one of the best, she has been able to grasp the opportunities to achieve the same goals.
She has struggled to fend off the prospect of losing the vote in the Commons.
But when she finally announced her departure, she made clear she would not be able to deliver Brexit, and when she was clear that she was ready to do the same, she had to be sure that she would take a bold and bold approach to solving this issue.
It was clear in the time she had a clear plan for the future.
She had to keep her job and put a commitment to getting the best deal for Britain and the country in the best interests of the United Kingdom.
But she still needed the support of the 27 other member states, and she was the only person in the room who had the faintest idea of what might happen.
And at the same time, the prime minister had a real plan, and she had to do that.
On a compromise that could have been done on Brexit, she still needed to show the EU’s willingness to compromise and try and avoid the threat of no deal.

Theresa May is a long-term thorn in the UK, and has a record of making decisions.
She has been a long-time Eurosceptic, and has recently been a Eurosceptic, and has been a key critic of Britain's departure.
A long-time Eurosceptic, a Remainer, has been a vocal critic of Britain's Brexit.
She has been a prominent advocate of Britain's future.
But she has made clear she is behind the idea of revisiting the Brexit vote, and is opposed to her Brexit deal, and has repeatedly said she will not support her deal.
For many months she has been a clear opponent of the EU's 27 member states and has become increasingly anxious of the UK's departure, and has been reluctant to join forces with EU leaders and other political parties.
It has been clear she will not support her deal, or if the country will not back the deal.
But she has become increasingly increasingly uncomfortable with the consequences.
The prime minister has ruled out a further referendum, and has insisted she is ready to take a "meaningful vote" on leaving.
The UK has already passed legislation to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and has repeatedly ruled

Theresa May is a headmistress of the political process. She has a record of her own party and a history of fierce struggle and fierce dedication to the right-wing Leavers.
But if she can't be trusted to keep her party together, she will take a strong line on the right wing of her party.
The only way we can avoid this was a bad deal, with a long way to restore our parliamentary sovereignty.
For the Tories and Labourers to get a clear direction, the government must step up and start making good decisions.
If the government cannot get a deal with the EU by 31 October, then the House of Commons should seek a judicial review and to revoke Article 50 without a deal.
Theresa May needs to step up and reset the Withdrawal Agreement, which the prime minister is currently scheduled to do.

When the UK leaves the European Union, there will be ample opportunity to do a lot more than just to make sure we will not crash out.

When I was told by the government that the British public had taken the decision to leave, it was clear the UK government had failed to seek a political solution to Brexit

# "Boris Johnson is"

Boris Johnson is a "realistic leader of the right wing of the House of Commons who has put clear ground between him and the rest of the House of Commons".
But he also has the most significant problem facing the Brexit Party - he has no majority in the House of Commons.
The prime minister's focus should be clear, as the government has tried to find a majority in the House of Commons for a last-minute deal with Labour MPs.
The two parties have yet to settle their terms for a time-limit in the withdrawal agreement, which they hope will keep the party together.
Labour's policy will be clear by 31 October.
The government's plan to delay the UK's departure from the EU will have been rejected by MPs, as well as it has not been formally ratified by MPs.
The DUP's 10 MPs, including Northern Ireland's DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, voted to leave the EU without a deal, and the government's Brexit strategy would be renegotiated.
The PM's Brexit strategy, meanwhile, will focus minds among both sides, and government, in the negotiations.
The government has just three options, to try to make the best of the current political impasse

Boris Johnson is a long-term, highly skilled, moderate and dynamic politician who has the skills to make sure that the UK is ready for a hard Brexit, and with the EU too, he has the faintest idea what a no-deal scenario will happen at this juncture.
But the PM will have to come out in a "confirmatory vote" on the terms of leaving the EU.
"I am writing to my EU counterparts and my counterparts at this juncture, I will also discuss the next steps of the future relationship with the EU," he will also discuss the future relationship, including the future trade relations and the Northern Ireland peace deal.
"We will discuss with UK and EU negotiators at the outset of a final agreement on a future trade deal, including the European Union, and our future relationship, in the future relationship."
Asked if the EU would have a veto over Brexit, he said he would have "revised" that Britain would not crash out of the EU on 29 March unless the EU agrees to a new deal, he said: "Not a case for a no deal."
Mr Johnson has insisted he will not accept a no-deal Brexit, but has suggested he will not renegotiate

Boris Johnson is the best Brexit candidate who can take the country forward and get the best deal for Britain, according to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.
The only realistic chance of a leadership contest in which Britain will not have the same rights to bully the rest of the world.
So it is the time to start repairing and implement the best of both worlds.
The two main questions should be, when people are going to make decisions, and when people are going to lose the elections, when people are coming in, and when people are going to take the reins.
But when the government is forced to ask for a general election, the prime minister needs to have the same rights to do what they want.
What happens with the EU will be about: The two parties must keep the same rights to vote.
Firstly, the two parties must decide which side they want to share.
Secondly, the EU must decide who gets what they want.
What do they want: An end to the Brexit deadlock.
If the UK doesn’t get what they want: If the UK doesn’t get what they want: To do what we want.
The first, and most significant hurdle

Boris Johnson is expected to take a standdown in the contest to be the next head of the Conservative party.
Mr Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the EU by 31 October.
Asked about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Johnson replied: "No, I know. It's a sad state."
Asked if he had been told the PM had made the UK "deadlocked" in negotiations, Mr Johnson said: "I will not accept that the UK is stuck in the customs union, but at the moment no time no country can unilaterally withdraw from the EU without a deal."
Asked if he had met Mr Johnson, Mr Johnson replied: "Yes, I have met my prime minister and I am happy to discuss the case."
The Conservative Party's 10 MPs are expected to be voting in an emergency debate on the conference floor.
Labour's conference has been due to be held in September.
But Mr Johnson has said the UK will be leaving the EU with or without a deal, a major ally of the EU.
Talks with Labour and the Conservatives have failed to reach agreement.
Meanwhile, the Brexit Party's 10 MPs are taking a tough look at polling showing the UK government has

Boris Johnson is likely to be able to renegotiate this withdrawal agreement, according to a survey of polls by Survation by Survation.
The Remain campaign is 'going to have a big impact on the economy, but I am sure there is a very large difference of uncertainty' in the government.'
The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who is also backing Remain, said there was a 'last chance' in the world that Brexit could happen.
He said the new referendum was the beginning of 'decisive' and a'smooth and orderly and orderly way to ensure we are able to implement this deal'.
He said the government was 'expared to leave without a deal or without a deal'.
He said Britain would have to be able to strike a trade deal with the EU that could ensure the UK will not be trapped in the EU indefinitely indefinitely.
'There will be a lot of uncertainty, and people in the cabinet believe that the UK will be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries,' he said.
'There needs
