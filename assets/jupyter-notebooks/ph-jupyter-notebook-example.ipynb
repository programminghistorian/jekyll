    "If you want use a computer to do any sort of data analysis, you need to make sure that the data is *clean*: consistently formatted using conventions the computer can work with. For instance, if you're manually counting all the times cats are mentioned in a text, you probably won't think twice about including \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"cats\", \"Cat--\", \"cat.\" as part of your count. Depending on your exact research question, you might also include related words like \"kitty\", \"kitten\", or \"feline\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a person do this task could take a lot of time, depending on the length of the text in question, but you can reasonably expect that a person will take all this variation into account when counting, especially if you ask them to count \"all words referring to cats\". Computers don't have the same understanding of a text that a person does, nor the same understanding of the concept of a cat. It may be possible to get a computer to count similar things to what a human would count when given this task, but first you need to do things to modify the text so that the computer doesn't get confused by minor variation (like capitalization or punctuation) that a human wouldn't necessarily give any thought to.\n",
