# What is this
This is a zip file version of https://github.com/amandavisconti/jekylldemo, for inclusion in the "Running a Collaborative Research Website and Blog with Jekyll and GitHub" lesson by @amandavisconti and @walshbr. 

# Why is this
We ask lesson readers to begin their work by creating their own repo from the files in this ZIP of a demo repo. The reason we're doing this rather than having them fork is that forking adds confusion to the PR process described in the lesson, and is otherwise not what users will see when using the lesson skills elsewhere.
