         <p>Extract of a letter.</p>
         <p>The population of Canada, in 1760, was reckoned at 62,000 souls, whilst her exports had never exceeded two millions of livres tournois (about 90,000l) The imports must have greatly
            exceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of the differences can be formed. The present population of the Canadas may be rated at 320,000 souls ; but great as this augmentation may
            appear, commerce will be found to have greatly surpassed the proportional ratio of the population.</p>
         <p>From 1763 to 1793, the exports may have varied from 120,000l. to 300,000l. chiefly of wheat, furs, and peltry. But, during the last 18 years, they have increased to the surprising sum of
            1,220,963l. 10s. Sterling, as we shall presently perceive by the following estimate, which cannot be much over or under the truth :-</p>
         <p>Furs and skims ... 105,000 0 Wheat, all other grain, flour, and biscuit 136,500 0 Lumber of all descriptions ... 536,500 0 Pot and pearl ashes ... 223,000 0 Beets and pork 30,000 0
            Sundries (too tedious to particularise) ... 16,000 10 The hulls, masts, and yards, of 28 ves sels built in the province ... 84,000 0 Total of domestic produce 1,131,000 0 Sundry goods
            imported and exported 4,780 0 1,125,780 0 </p>
         <p>Commissions and additional charges at 7 1/2 per cent. Sterling ... 65,183 0 t. 1,220,963</p>
         <p>The amounts of imports of dutiable articles at Quebec is about 380,000l. Sterling. It is impossible to ascertain the value of goods not dutiable ; but we may safely conlude, that they will
            make the total of import as one million Sterling, leaving a balance in favour of these provinces, which, but a few years ago, would have appeared incredible. This property is carried by
            661 vessels, whose tonnage is 143,893, navigated by 6758 seamen. The freight and primage on these vessels are nine guineas per ton, being 1,359,788l. 17s. Sterling, which, without taking
            into consideration the charges in Britain, will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed, exceed 3,000,000l. Sterling, being about a tenth of the imports of the United Kingdom.</p>
         <p>Our commerce has become considerable with the United States. A few years ago, our imports from thence greatly exceeded our exports. But since respectable and intelligent American merchants
            have begun to settle amongst us, I believe the scale turned in our favour ; and thus British industry is commencing to run in a channel never before much thought of.</p>

         <p>Our latest accounts from the West Indies say, that no supply from the islands, either of wheat or flour, can possibly be obtained from the American states in consequence of the great
            bounties given by his Most Christian Majesty on these articles. Our charity, therefore, if we have any of these articles to spare, must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we
            cannot be surprised, particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home, that no assistance can be given at present, either to the French or Dutch.</p>
         <p>The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest, except to the eastward, which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part.</p>
         <p>By the Westmoreland, just arrived from Jamaica, we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree, ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the
            Slave Trade.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Quebec, June 6.</p>
         <p>"We are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great scarcity of flour throughout the province. Common flour sold this morning in the market at six dollars, per cwt. bran from 7s.
            6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel, and pease 20d. per bushel. There has been an account taken of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city, and liberties, by order of the Governor and
            Council, and we find there is not more than will serve as ten days. They ar much worse off in the district of Montreal than we are here: We have sent them frequent supplies.</p>
         <p>"Wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three livres, now sells at two dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of fifteen hundred pounds by this job.</p>
         <p>"Government, for the relief of the poor, have caused to be issued, by the contractor here, rise at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday
            there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way.</p>
         <p>"In consequence of letters by last Thursday's post from Montreal, two thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for that market. We have not had a grain of flour from
            England or the States, though we hear of a cargo from New York, for Montreal. The vessel was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more than probably, that people there, being in great want
            themselves, have detained her. The Government have done now what they should have done five or six months ago, and then we should not be in this starving condition ; that is, we are to
            have a proclamation to permit the importation of grain and flour from the States.</p>
         <p>"My servant is just come home from the baker's, where I had sent him for half a dollar's worth of bread. After watching for two hours, till the bread came out of the overn, he could get
            but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves, indeed, weighing only two pounds each. Thirty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. The Lord knows what will become of us–except
            Government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops, in the Queen.</p>
         <p>"Mr. Davidson, one of the Council, assured us on Thursday last, there was not wheat and flour</p>
         <p>in the country for five weeks. He has taken a great deal of pains to be well informed on the subjuct; and to him are we indebted for the proclamation to allow the importation from the
            States. He stood forth alone, and offered, at his own expence, to get an account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town and liberties of Quebec, and insisted on its being
            taken into consideration."</p>

         <p>Cent is the only coinage the Americans have of their won. No less than 300 ton of them were contracted for by Congress in the year 1787, to be coined at the rate of 50 ton per annum ; the
            contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous Jersey copper. They are a little larger than the British halfpence. No British copper no passes in the United States;–silver
            and gold coins of all nations, however, pass current. The congress have not yet ordered a silver coinage.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda tohis friend in Norfolk, Virginia, dated April 2.</p>
         <p>"By Captain Gilbert, the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi - sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt.
            George, from Baltimore, brought in ???days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immeddiately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour, common and superfine, which sold
            at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George; and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great number of poor
            people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, by advice of his counsel, has opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever,
            for thirty days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, laden with bread, corn; or flour. He also allows, for three months, the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port
            whatever, in vessels belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation, they will be allowed to dispose of their
            cargo, if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from Norfolk, with provisions, advise them to call at Bermuda."</p>

         <p>THE following extract from a late publication, entitled, " A State of the present Government of the Province of Quebec," will give the public some idea of the Canada Bill, which has been
            so much talked of an procrastinated so long, and at present pending in Parliament. The work we understand to be the production of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by the province to negotiate
            this afair. It is remarkable,withhis former publication, for its strong nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.</p>
         <p>"Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all mankind. The security which flows from a free constitution, to both political and civil liberty, contributes greatly towards bringing forth the
            powers of the human mind, and the encouragement of the industry of people ; but no constitution can be called free where the people are not allowed to participate of the legislative
            authority by their representatives : This is the great criterion of freedom; and it is extremely natural for all British subjects, as they know the value of it, to struggle for such a
            valuable right. Great Britain has constantly acknoledged this principle in the constitution she has granted to all her Colonies; and by that means has rendered them more flourishing and
            prosperous than those of other nations. Although the inhabitants of the province of Quebec have, from the general tendency of the British government to a mild administration, enjoyed a
            certain degree of civil liberty; yet they have been, from the peculiar nature of the system of their government, entirely deprived of all political liberty. A more full enjoyment of these
            essential privileges has been the prayer of their petitions, and of those now before the House of commons. The objects prayed for may be reduced to the following heads:–</p>
         <p>"1. An elective house of assembly or representatives of the people. 2. That the members of the legislative council receive no salaries as counsellors. 3. That the habeas corpus act, and
            the other laws of England relating to personal liberty,be made a part of the constitution. 4. That trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part of the constitution, and that nine
            out of twelve may return a verdict. 5. That the ancient laws and customs of Canada, relative to landed property, marriage settlements, inheritance, and dowers, be continued in force in the
            districts or</p>

         <p>Curious Anecdote.–A few days ago a stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East India Company, and desired to speak to him in private ; when the were retired, the stranger said to
            Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from India, I have smuggled goods to the amount of about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, "That he could
            receive no such money without the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possible. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. The Company pays
            for the exclusive privilege of bringing India goods to Europe; the man that deprives them of any part of the advantages they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion, look upon himself
            as a strictly honest man." Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, the Chairman had not had time to give him an answer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a letter, including a Bank
            note of 30l. The sum Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid any thing.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from India, by the Dublin East Indiaman, to Mr. William Jones</p>
         <p>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to Decca, and arrived there after a passage of 16 days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, and it was really a shocking sight to behold; you could
            not move out of your house but the corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them to ashes, if they
            can afford it; if not, throw them into the river. I have lately seen a man brought to the river side, and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead ; and when the the tide flowed, it
            carried him off. If a man, woman, or child, dies at night, the corpse is eaten by the morning. This I have been an eye witness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback every morning, I
            had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not. In the course of six months I became so much used to it, that I took no notice of it.</p>
         <p>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration took place, and burnt upwards of seven miles without intermission, and many souls perished. Now consider, first, an inundation; second, a famine;
            and third, a conflagration. How much the place must be distressed, I leave you to think. I left Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at Calcutta, after a passage through the
            Sunderburns (in 17 days), hearty and well, thank God."</p>

         <p>The old system of sending men of rank to govern Jamaica, seems to be revived, and laudably too.</p>
         <p>This island is the most important possession we hold in the West Indies, and is well entitled to any mark of distinction which the parent country can bestow upon it.</p>
         <p>The salary and emoluments annexed to the government of Jamaica, render it the most valuable of any in the King's gift, except that of Ireland.</p>
         <p>Soon after the Restoration, O'Brian, third Earl of Inchiquin, was appointed Governor of Jamaica, and died in his Government.</p>
         <p>Henry Bentinck, first Duke of Portland, was made Governor of this island in the reign of George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town, July 4th, 1736, in the 45th year of his age.</p>
         <p>The death of these two Noblemen in their government, gave so bad an impression of the climate of Jamaica, and the insalubrity of its air, that few persons of rank and fortune have been
            ambitious of becoming governors of it, notwith standing the brilliancy of the appointments an nexd to the situation.</p>

            Colonel Despar, with the assistance of the Calypso sloop of war, keeps the woodcutters in order. This may rise the price of mahogany at home, and certainly will raise provisions here.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter form Philadelphia, dated 25th May, 1789.</p>
         <p>"I have travelled through several of the States and see no appearance of the poverty which you hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they
            procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain, and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other
            place.</p>
         <p>"I think I never say so many children as are in this country, every town, village, and farm-house, are full of them.–The people of this country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they
            double their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods, for when so many hundreds of millions of
            acres of land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a small price, the people of this country never will manufacture ; At present wages are high, and 1000 acres of land in the back
            settlements may be purchased for as many pence?."</p>

            in the upper country, about Niagara and Montreal, have been without bread for four months.</p>
         <p>There are orders now in town for as many goods for Quebec as will load ten ships; the trade being so exceedingly brisk, and the people giving the preference to European goods.</p>

         <p>Lord M'Donald, to his great honour, adopted a most liberal plan of establishing, at his own expence, not only one, but a number of free-villages, on his extensive domains. By this plan,
            proposed to his Lordship by Mr. Fraser, the settlers are to have perpetual feus of the lands, subject to a very moderate quit rent. His Lordship will by this means prevent the threatened
            emigrations to America, and deserve the highest praises of his country.</p>

         <p>A short DESCRIPTION of, and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY, being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774.</p>
         <p>T HAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain, is wha the whole world knows, and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny:
            It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform our readers, that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since
            the beginning of their rebellion, viz. Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana, and The Western Territory.</p>
         <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has
            been the population, that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789, and
            contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States, published in America in May last, we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of
            them, called The Western Territory ; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it, and think, that the settling of these countries, though the Americans double their numbers
            every 15 or 20 years, will long keep them from manufacturing, and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman, even though wages are
            very high, when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thousand acres of land, that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of
            our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect, that new channels of commerce will be
            opened, and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by means of a most
            extraordinary inland navigation, will be diffused through a country more fertile, more extensive, than all the Thirteen United States.</p>
         <p>The Western TerritoryIs the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by
            the Ohio river; contains, according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, from which he deducts
            forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government, which is to be sold for the discharge of the
            debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*.</p>
         <p>On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta, the other at Miami.</p>
         <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787, and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhocking,
            Sioto, Miami, Wobash,&amp;c–Coal and iron mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined, and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with
            little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy, pleasant, and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States.
            The timber is tall, and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country
            will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties, and fulfill the description of travellers, who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably
            also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild
            game of every kind; herds of deers, elks, bears, &amp;c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies, geese, swans, and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The rivers are
            excellently stored with fish, and almost all navigable for small sloops.</p>
         <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory, they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30,000 persons; and when they acquire a certain
            degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States.</p>
         <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you, and you only!</p>
         <p>* No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.</p>

         <p>[ Continued from our last.] Carlisle, July 29.</p>
         <p>O N Saturday last between three and four o'clock, P. M. happened the most violent hurricane pest, or thunder storm (for we are at a lost to determine its proper name) that was ever known
            in this borough or its vicinity. We can conceive of nothing but an earthquake, that could be attended with more alarming circumstances. The cloud from the west, or rather a number of
            clouds of a lowering aspect, furiously agitated, broken, and seemingly ready to fall– attracted the attention, and prepared the mind in some measure for what was to follow. The lightening
            appeared to those who were at a distance, remarkably red, and seemed to flash from the cloud to the earth and back again, in quick succession or some time, as to appear one sheet of flame.
            This might have had a great effect on the air, at some miles distance from town, to set it in rapid motion, especially when pressed down by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the
            earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as thrown from buckets, and being carried along and dashed against every opposing object by a
            most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a manner, that all surrounding objects seemed lost in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole town in ruins, with such irresistible force
            did the column of air move on: happily however, the damages were much less than apprehended. The The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Davidson, being an an elevated spot near the
            west end of the town, and lying directly in the line of march of this powerful column, was the first sufferer; all the parts of the building above the square were suddenly borne off, and a
            great part of the roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house, which stood at a small distance on the east, striking it forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and fell on the adjoining
            lot. Mr. Paton's house is left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. After injruing some smaller buildings in its course to the eastward, the next elevated object to which it pointed
            its fury, was the presbyterian church in the certain of town–a building of uncommon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to stand for ages, admist all the war of the elements. About a
            fourth part, however of the roof of the north side was carried off, with the weighty cornice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred yards distance on the east side of the open square
            which is in the centre of this borough. After leaving the town it beat its course to the public buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest the town. Many fences in the
            neighbourhood, which were in the line of its direction, were also thrown down; but how far it extended, or what damages the farmers may have sustained we have not yet learned. Let it,
            however, not be forgotten, that dreadful as the scene was, through the good providence of God, not a single life was lost or any personal injury, worth mentioning, received, and the
            buildings, it is hoped, will soon be restored to as good a state as they were in before.</p>

         <p>We are happy in informing our readers, that in the memory of the oldest man among us a more plentiful year has not been known than the present. Neither mildew nor fly has affected the
            wheat; the grain is heavy, and full, and in large quantities. The other grains are likewise plentiful, and of an excellent quality. Such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the
            inhabitants of the United Sates, to the great Author of Nature; especially when these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy, and with the
            establishment of a wise, free, and just government.</p>

         <p>By a gentleman who arrived in this city on Friday last from the county of Ontario in the Genesee county (the territory lately ceded by this state to the commonwealth of Massachusetts) we
            are informed, that four days before he left that county, Colonel Brant from Niagara, at the head of between 16 and 1800 of the principal Sachems, and other Indians of the Six Nations, had
            arrived at Conadoque, the seat of Oliver Phelps, Esq; on a visit of friendship, and at the same time to receive the money due them for the lands sold to the company of Messrs. Gorham and
            Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps and the principal inhabitants of Conadoque, four miles from that place, and conducted into town –That they were highly gratified with the treatment
            they received, and with the manner in which they had disposed of their lands.–The gentleman further informs, that there is now about 3000 inhabitants in the above county, and that the land
            is of a good quality.</p>

         <p>The weather last week, in this city, and suburbs, continued to be extremely hot until Sunday midnight, after a thunder squall. The change which then took place was very sudden and
            unhealthy.</p>
         <p>Upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy [?]ic tions to the heat last week; and it is said, that as many of them died by over labouring as by drinking cold water, Raw rum has been found
            exceedingly pernicious in this extreme heat; –man who was seen intoxicated but a few momments before, suddenly fell on one of those days –and the cry was–" Poor fellow! he has certainly
            drank too much cold water!" Cold water has however been instantaneously fatal in se - veral instances. [ To be concluded in our next.]</p>

         <p>We have been favoured by a friend with the following extract of a letter from Grenada, by the last West India Packet.</p>
         <p>"A Mr. C– has just arrive here from Martinico, where he left the white inhabitants in arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea, that the Parliament of England had set the English
            negroes free ; where upon those on several of the most considerable estates assembled together to the amount of 4000, and retired to the mountains, declaring, they would no longer be
            slaves ; saying, that they had as good a right to be free, as the negroes in the English islands. What has been the event is unknown ; but some reports say that they had arms, and had
            resisted the military and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken and condemned to die. It is a little singular that such an alarming spirit of discontent should first make its
            appearance among the French negroes, if they are (as has been assented by several writers) so much more civilized, so much better treated, than those of the English islands. God knows what
            bloodshed may soon follow, from the mistaken humanity of some well meaning, but ill informed leaders among you."</p>

         <p>Trade is reviving in America to a very great degree –and such is the appearance of things that in a very few years, we may expect to see as firm an union of mercantile interests, betwixt
            this country and the United States, as ever subsisted. It is in vain to instil prejudices against Great Britain, in the mind of an American merchant ; he knows this to be the ready-money
            market, and he will come to it accordingly.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Danville, (Kentucky) to his friend in Baltimore </p>
         <p>"It is with great concern I communicate to you the following truly melancholy intelligence: –About three weeks ago, Mr. Richard Chenoweth, had six or eight men allowed him, by the officer
            of the garrison at the Falls, to guard his exposed plantation, in Bear Crab Settlement, below the Falls. In the evening of their arrival, before they had taken their station as a guard, a
            number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's house, killed two of the soldiers, and three of Mr. Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and scalped his wife, leaving her on the floor for
            dead– Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the savages) with the rest of the men, made their escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's children sick, in a chamber, and, it is reported,
            she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; but, next morning, crawling down stairs, she was inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved parent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth
            returned next day to his house, and carried his wife to a neighbouring plantation, where they are both likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she wants to return to her own house.–The
            savages have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. –A small company are gone to White River, to extirpate 80 or 90 Indians, who, as spies have informed, have upwards of 300 horses,
            &amp;c. at that place."</p>

         <p>"What mighty contests rise from trivial things;"</p>
         <p>That the present Revolution in France is a consequence of the Revolution in America, cannot admit of a doubt. The American Revolution originated in Adams, a very insignificant Bostonian.
            Not that this Adams had the least expectation of American independence, when he fomented the opposition to the stamp-act; indeed no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen the subsequent
            folly and imprudence of the British administration and its obsequious Parliament. An Administration so totally destitute of common sense, so totally ignorant of every princple of sound
            policy, no nation ever beheld. Adams had the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable policies.–Fortunately for the American cause, the Generals that were sent from England were of
            congenial abilities with the Minister, and the Americans themselves were surprised at the facility with which they acquired their independence. –Yet all the blunders of the British
            administration, and the miserable conduct of the British Generals, would hardly have been sufficient to emancipate America, notwithstanding her extreme weakeness, without the assistance of
            France; and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-philippic of a certain great lawyer. Such, therefore, is the chain of concurrent
            circumstances that hath overturned the French monarch. If the British minister had possessed common sagacity–if he could have distinguished a general from a corporal; if Franklin had been
            treated with common civility, America would have remained a British colony, and France an absolute monarch, for ages yet to come.</p>

         <p>Mr. Ephraim Daniel, of Baker's-row, Mileend, received the following letter from a friend in Holland last week:</p>
         <p>"Sir, your friend L–y, who is just come here from the East Indies, desires me to inform you, that your unfortunate relation who left you with the transports for Botany Bay, was well in
            February last. He has settled at Port Jackson, and has leave to teach the children of some of your nation to read and write in your own way. The place is much improved since you ahve had
            any letters form it, as there was no person without a habitation, and being in some order, when he left it. Except wearing apparel, very little is wanting but business ; but you may thank
            the Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought several useful things there. The last crops of corn, and the garden grounds, were in very good condition : and what makes the settlement
            more convenient, one of the people who came in the first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that of Delft or elsewhere. He was
            surprised to see so many people without hats or shoes, and houses without windows, and full of wicker and rush furniture, which is used in the place of almost every thing else. If the
            smiths had a plentiful supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would be wanting. Your nephew has two children, and says all that are born there are very healthy, and more born than
            are buried or executed of grown people. The Christians Church was quite finished before he came away ; and he thinks if there were enough of your people, they might have a place to
            themselves. The farthest of the lines was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was reported when he came away, that as soon as more troops and a new Governor comes over, they would go
            farther than ever up the country, when some valuable discovers are expected to be made ; they have a gum which may be used for gum arabic, which is veyr useful. He expects several of your
            people will go from Batavia to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way for sending old clothes is not yet found out. Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that it is not worth a
            stranger's while to land there ; and as little is said about it there, as if it was as far off as Europe, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

         <p>They have also resolved to sell four or five millions of acres of land, instead of two millions which they sold annually in the States; the produce of which will son suffice to prevent the

         <p> The West India merchants, who were in the utmost anxiety for the arrival of the packet from the West Indies, have been most agreebly relieed from their apprehensions. The account of the
            insurrections in Martinique, which we received through France, and which has been since confirmed in the National Assembly, naturally alarmed them for the British islands. We are happy to
            inform our readers, that the packet brings no intelligence whatever of tumult of insurrections. We have not heard even that the letters bring any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ;
            a circumstance which can only be accounted for by the little communication which exists between the islands at this season of the year."</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Dominica, Sept. 6.</p>
         <p>"This day week the most diabolical design that that ever was formed, was discovered in Martinico : It was an insurrection of the negroes, who were that night to have set fire to the large
            and beautiful town of St. Pierre ; while the white people were all in confusion, and striving to escape the flames, they were to be butchered indiscriminately, man woman, and child.–The
            combustibles were laid in upwards of 100 houses, consisting of hemp dipped in turpentine. The plot was not discovered till five o'clock in the evening, when a negro belonging to an old
            lady, stung with remorse on thinking that he must murder the woman who brought him up form a child, disclosed it to her. The Troops being thereupon assembled, 40 of the negroes were taken,
            armed with a hanger and a long knife, the insturments which were in a few hours to have put a period to the existence of upwards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have been under arms
            ever since, as they are afraid the negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in gaol."</p>

         <p>" Living out of the World"</p>
         <p>To the PRINTER.</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>ABOUT two month ago I went to the country to pay a visit to a friend in a remote county; and though I am much of what may be called "a newspaper man," I never thought of ordering my papers
            to be sent down to me. To my utter astonishment, my rustic landlord did not take in own newspaper; so there was I, stuck down, with my friend in the country–knowing no more of what passed
            in town than if I had been in Lapland. Intending every day should be my last, I went on without ordering your, or any other paper, till two months had passed away, at which period I
            returned to town. And there, Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had dropped down from the clouds. Every day I heard people talking of occurrences of which I knew nothing :
            Revolutions in France by Fishwomen ; and battles in Flanders, against the Emperor, who I thought was fighting against the Turks.</p>
         <p>But even this was not the most distressing–for one day meeting a friend, I inquired very cordially after his wife, who I found a few days afterwards, had eloped just before with another
            gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquired kindly for her sister, who I found had departed to the other world a fortnight before.</p>
         <p>On this account I never will stir again "out of the world" unless your paper goes along with me. I hold a newspaper to be a kind of viaticum with which every man should be provided, and
            which become the more necessary the further we remove from town It. is the only way to keep pace with what is going on every day in the fashionable or literary world–and to prevent talking
            about dead friends, or wives that have absconded.</p>
         <p>In short, Sir, a newspaper is my creed –and never will I again travel without my faith along with me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness of being sent back into the world as
            ignorant as if I had been born again– I hereby give notice – "That if an hottentot friend of mine invites me, who does not take in your paper or some other– I will not visit him." DICK
            DESPERATE.</p>

         <p>Account of a singular Sect called Shaking QuakERS in America.</p>
         <p>I N the United States of America there are some Jews, and various denomications of Christians, –as Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers,
            Dunkers, Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, Sandimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; all of whom are allowed to perform religious worship accoridng to the dictates of their
            consciences.</p>
         <p>The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all of which were said to be Europeans, were the
            founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew thousands of people after them, who pretended they were visited with power from on high to work miracles, heal the sick, raise the dead,
            cast out devils, and speak in unknown languages.</p>
         <p>This Lady risided in the north-westerly part of the State of New York, where she began to instil her tenets into some of the people there:– afterwards she rambled from place to place,
            promulgating her religion, and gaining proselytes in New England, and elsewhere:–she engrossed the kingdom of heaven to herself and followers, to the seculsion of all others.</p>
         <p>She pretended her mission was immediately from heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect, –could speak in seventry-two unknown languages, in which she conversed with those that had
            departed this life,–that there had not been a true church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, until her's was erected,–that both the living and the dead must be saved, in, by, and
            through her –must confess their sins unto her, and procure her parson, or they could not be saved;–that that she gathered her church from both earth and hell, as every person that had died
            since the time of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was damned, and that they were ocntinually making intercession to her for salvation, which was the occasion of her talking to
            them in those unknown tongues.</p>
         <p>Those that entered into her church were obliged to confess their sins, and deliver up their jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches, &amp;c. to be disposed of as she thought fit.</p>
         <p>It has been reported that some of these confessions proved very beneficial; for some of her church members owned they had stolen things that had been laid to innocent persons.</p>
         <p>When these people carry on their worship, they pretend to praise the Lord by singing, dancing, jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling, &amp;c. and in the mean time some will be
            trembling, groaning, sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are preaching, praying, exhorting, &amp;c. others will be clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, screaming, and making such a
            hideous noise, that it may be heard at a great distance, and will often affrighten the spectators.</p>
         <p>They often dance three hours without intermission, and when any of them are tired of praising the Lord that way, they are whipped by others, to make the worship go on briskly. They dance
            till they are much emaciated ; the young women grow pale, appear like ghosts or apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard, –if I may use the sailor's phrase.</p>
         <p>They make no use of the Eucharist, or of water baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars, fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain language, and cry– yea, and nay, instead of yes and
            no : but the other Quakers do not approve of all their tenets.</p>
         <p>At particular times they labour very hard at their respective occupations, and are very careful that no time is spent in idleness.</p>
         <p>They pretend they hold a correspondence with the saints and angels, and that they frequently see and converse with the spirits of their departed friends.</p>
         <p>Many of them refuse to be with their wives, because they suppose they are part of the hundred and forty and four thousand mentioned in the Revelations that were redeemed from the earth,
            and were not defiled with women.</p>
         <p>They hold, that they have already been made partakers of the first resurrection, and that on them the second death will have no power.</p>
         <p>They do not allows the instrumental music in their churches, because they suppose it was ceremonial, and is abolished;–but pretend that they carry on their worship by the immediate power
            and influence of the Holy Ghost, and that they have scripture warrents for their practice, a[?]– Sing unto God,–Praise the Lord in the dance; –O clap your hands, all ye people;–Shout on to
            God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down before the Lords,&amp;c.</p>

         <p>Martinique, Oct. 6.</p>
         <p>The disturbances in this island are so far from having abated, that they seem daily to gain additional force. The French General, after the and endeavoured to bring over a part of the
            military to his side, against the people : He began with subalterns, several of whom took a certain oath of attachment which he administered to them ; but when he came to the Major, that
            officer declined, saying he had already engaged himself on the side of the people. Incensed at this reply, he reviled him in very opprobrious terms, and at last laid his cane upon him
            !</p>
         <p>Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, he made his next application to the regiment of artillery, but with as little success. They informed him, that themselves and Culverins were
            stationed there for the protection of the people, and for them only should be used.</p>
         <p>Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested the sorry expedient of having recourse to the people of colour, who here form a considerable corps. By a small dose of flattery these
            people, so readily to be caught by a little seeming attention, promised to stand by him ; and did so, as long as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is, till their fears for their
            own persons became an object of more weighty concern–they then abandoned him.</p>
         <p>The humiliating familiarities to which he descended to this motley rabble, were truly disgusting. He embraced them; called them his enfans and cher amis, and practised all the dirty
            condescensions, which those only who are conversant in the praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any conception of.</p>
         <p>The effect of this conduct was, as might be expected, insolence–one of this banditti presumed to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the military and the peopl–the consequence was, their
            doughty leader was laid hold of, when his trusty defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding from the windows of his prison, him whom he
            had inspired with the insolent temerity to strike White, suspended on a gibbet.</p>
         <p>The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled to confer on the measures to be taken on this occasion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring the deposed Commander to that part of the island
            for trial, and twelve Judges were chosen to preside at that very important tribunal.</p>
         <p>Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary and ingenious method of being put between two
            planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Philadelphia, Aug. 23.</p>
         <p>"Congress is still sitting at New York, and from the multiplicity of business before them, there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. We are curious to know what foreigners will
            say</p>
         <p>of our new commercial arrangements. Among ourselves there is but one opinion, and that is faavourable. o our own vessels, a preference is undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and
            merchandise, there is no discrimination in our import and tonnage acts, every nation being on the same footing. With respect to the duties themselves, they could not be laid lower,
            considering the demand of supplies, which the Committee appointed to give in an estimate state at upwards of eight millions of dollars.</p>
         <p>"Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of improvement in politics and commerce, we feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expecttion of the
            f–deral government's acting with the energy and effect that will give it respectability. The prejudices and animosities created by the late contest are gradually dying away ; and to the
            idleness and dissipation flowing from the same source, industry has in a great degree succeeded. A progress has also been made in manufactures of various kinds that was not expected ; and
            the persevering in them affords a strong presumption of those concerned deriving advantage.</p>
         <p>"Throughout the union, the public opinion on matters of government has of late experienced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated the
            absurdity of democracy, and the superior excellence of a mix form, such as that of Britain. His deductions from premises admitted as just, have abated much of the popular aversion to
            monarchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise many, were United America to have a sovereign earin the next century.</p>
         <p>"In no one instance has our new admnistration given general satisfaction, more than in their conduct towards the Indians. The interests of those unfortunate people will be studiously
            attended to ; and they will be effectually protected against the lawless violence of the individuals or States, who wished to wrest their lands from them. This determination is dictated by
            policy as well humanity ; for it is now become the interest of the States to check, by every means short of violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, who, when removed to the
            wilds beyond the mountains, cannot be regarded as of any value, in a political view.</p>

         <p>Governor Philips describes Port Jackson, which is only about nine miles to the Northward of Botany Bay in South Wales, on the Coast of Holland, as one of the finest harbours in the world,
            in which 1000 sail of the line might ride in perfect security. Sydney cove, named so in honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor chose in preference, which is about hal a mile in length, and a
            quarter of a mile across at the entrance. Here was the finest spring water, and ships can anchor so close in short, that at a very small expence quays may be constructed, at which the
            largest vessels may constantly unload. His meeting with the natives here was friendly and uninterrupted. The appearance of the place was picturesque and pleasing, and it afforded an ample
            harvest for botanical acquisitions.</p>

         <p>The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans, which will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great
            Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have
            to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French, and are Roman Catholics.
            The former are Protestants.</p>
         <p>Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war, but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, if the
            first commercial nation in the world.</p>
         <p>Besides these considerations, the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power, that the best riddance England ever had, was of her American Colonies ;
            because by this means, she becomes thoroughly collected at home, to oppose every foreign power, without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans, at the same time that they cannot
            do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another.</p>
         <p>Thus, they are under the necessity of protecting themselves, at the same time, that, like the rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market.</p>
         <p>Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin, in aid of the present want of silver for circulation, the
            scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular.</p>

         <p>Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arrived there from Hispaniola, there are advices that the French inhabitants of that island feel, with unabating energy, the glorious cause in
            which their patriotic countrymen in Old France are embarked. Men of every class and description wear the national cockade of blue and white. Their accounts from France, similar in date and
            substance to ours, have filled them with the most lively hopes, and animated them with a spirit of resistance to the measures of their Government, as forcible as it was unexpected by those
            entrusted with the executive power. At Port au Prince both the Governor and Intendant have rendered themselves completely odious, by vain attempts to counteract an impulse that is
            irresistible. The effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has been hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that both shall immediately quit the colony, and their departure is hourly
            expected. The press, hitherto under the severest restraint, triumphs in its freedom; and their weekly publications give an account of the proceedings of the States General without the
            smallest reserve.</p>

         <p>The following philosophical facts lead us to presume that the winter now setting in, will prove a mild one : It has been constantly remarked, that when this season commences early, and
            with severity, in Newfoundland, and the more northern part of North America, it becomes extremely rigorous, and of a proportionate continuance there. When, in the above climate, the
            winters have been severe, they have invariably been mild with us, and vice versa. Now, the ships which sailed from Newfoundland the beginning of October last, saw the hills already covered
            with snow. There is still another argument in favour of a mild winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always observed to have
            provided an uncommon store of wild briar fruits, as a nourishment to the smaller birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to prevent
            their coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which they are accustomed to feed. The present season, the store of these wild fruits is extremely moderate.</p>

            less than ten thousand of them assembled in one body, and there are now above four thousand encamped in the neighbourhood of St. Pierre's. The business, it is said, has originated from an
            idea they have got, that all the slaves in the British colonies are to be liberated, and they are resolved to be upon the same footing."</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Portsmouth, Nov. 23.</p>
         <p>"The convicts already arrived at this port from Newfoundland, are near fourscore in number; a few others are expected. These unhappy wretches are almost destitute of every sort of
            covering, and some of them are labouring under sickness and infirmity. Their story is accurateas follows: About the middle of last June, this miserable class of beings, to the amount of
            102 men and boys, and twelve women, all of whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, on board the Duke of Leinster transport, the owners of which, who are Dublin merchants, contracted
            with the Government of Ireland for carrying the convicts to the North American States.</p>
         <p>"After the ship had been at sea five weeks, part of which was foul weather, the provision is said to have fallen short ; the master of the transport, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in
            for Newfoundland and lay-to till night; when he disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little distance from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his desperate freight.</p>
         <p>"To prevent this proceeding being too early early known, he landed with them provision for the immediate supply of their wants, and bore away with a press of sail. The hungry victims lived
            for three days in a state of warfare, quarrelling about their food ; the strongest beat the weak, and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there was for a time as severe fighting as if a
            kingdom had been at stake.</p>
         <p>"They reached the town of St. John's on the 20th of July ; and exhibited the most appaling procession ever seen in that country : the inhabitants had immediate councils; and the military
            and navy co-operating, a place of security was fixed upon at a distance from the town, and they were lodged ; here under a guard.</p>
         <p>"Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full chorus, and the centinels were frequently frighted with the noise while on their posts. A battle or two every half hour kept them festive all
            day; and when the provision supplied to them by the inhabitants was lessening, they broke away, and laid hold of every thing that was eatable, without enquiring whether it had an
            owner.</p>
         <p>"Some of these poor wretches were anxious to be received into the service of the inhabitants and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. But all of them have a claim to the charity
            of this country for that supply of raiment which is necessary to guard them against the inclement weather."</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at CharlesTown, South Carolina, September 2, 1789, to a friend in Bristol. </p>
         <p>"My inclination has taken such a stubborn longing after your side of the water, that I cannot enjoy tranquility here. So very wretched have I been at times, that I can hardly support the
            regret I feel, that I ever changed the bright and alluring varieties of cultivation England, for the dreary the desolate scenes of America.</p>
         <p>"Happy are those who have quitted this land of misery ; and I belive a situation here is not found enviable by the greatest patriots in the State. They are all in the secret, sighing for
            the comforts of Old England. A bare pittance there, would be preferable to the largest possessions here."</p>

         <p>Boston, October 26.</p>
         <p>Saturday, between the hours of two and three, arrived in town from New-York, the PRESIDENT of the United States.</p>
         <p>The inhabitants of this metropolis have now the happiness to felicitate themselves on having among them the virtuous General, who delivered their capital from the oppression of a British
            foe; and in the same person the magnanimous President of the United States of America.–The President left New-York on Thursday the 15th instant, to visit the Eastern States, attended ouly
            by his two private secretaries and servants– Actuated by the principles of a true republican Patriot, and considing in the ardent affections of the citizens in the States through which he
            had to pass, he had it in vic??? travel without the</p>
         <p>temporary parade which his dignified station might justly clam but wherever he came his merits were already known, and the people, with heartfelt joy, and high approbation of his virtues,
            saluted him the Defender of their Freedom and Independence. –The worthy Governor of this Commonwealth haivng an exalted estimation of the virtuous President, and although much indisposed
            as to his health, was determined to shew the President the honours of the government in a stile suitable to his dignity; accordingly he ordered the troops of Middlesex horse to escort him
            through that county, and permitted General brooks to exhibit to the President on Cambridge Common, as he passed, a fine body of the militia of the 3d division, consisting of about 1000
            men, all in complete uniform and equipment. The President was honoured with a salute as he passed them. The Governor requested the Lieutenant Governor and the Council, to meet the
            President at Cambridge (and would have accompanied them himself hand his health permitted) whither they were escorted by col. Tyler's corps of the horse. The Lieutenant governor and
            Council met him there, and preceded the President under the escort of horse, and introduced him to the capital of the commonwealth.</p>
         <p>From the best accounts we are able to collect, we present the following as the</p>
         <p>Order of Procession.The Independent company of Light Infantry commanded by Major Otis. The Independent Fusiliers, commanded by Cap- tain-lieutenant Laughton. The Independent Cadets, under
            the command of Major Scollay. Company of Artillery, commanded by Captain Johnson. /[Altogether commaned by Colonel Bradford.] Music. Constables of the town. Deputy-Sheriffs. The
            Select-Men. Town-Clerk. Committee of Arrangements. The High Sheriff. the Council of the Commonwealth. The Lieutenant-Governor Marshal of Massachusetts District. The PRESIDENT on horseback;
            with his Suite. Overseers of the Poor. Town-Treasurer. Magistrates. Consul of Holland. The Reverend Clergy. Physicians, &amp;c. Lawyers. Merchants, shopkeepers, and Traders. Then followed
            the Artizans, Tradesmen, nufacturers, &amp;c. of the town, in order, with flags, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>On the President's arrival at the State-house, he ascended a temporary balcony, adjoining the gallery, where were a select choir of singers, who, upon the President's appearance, sang the
            following</p>
         <p>ODE to Columbia's Favourite SON.1. Great Washington, The Hero's come, Each heart exulting hearts the sound, Thousands to their Deliverer throng, And shout him welcome all around! Now its
            full chorus join the songs, And shout aloud great Washington.</p>
         <p>2. There view columbia's favourie Son, Her Father, Saviour, Friend, and Guide! There see th' immortal Washington ! His Country Glory, Boast, and Pride Now in full chorus, &amp;c. 3. When
            the impending storm of War, Think clouds and darkness hid our way, Great Washington, our Polar Star, Arose; and all was light as day. Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>4. 'Twas on your plains they valour rose, And ran like fire from man to man; 'Twas here thou humbled Paria's foes, And chac'd whole legions to the main! Now in full corus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>5. Thro' countless dangers, toils and???Our Hero led us safely on– With matchless skill directs the wars, 'Till Vict'ry cried–The day's his own! Now in full chorus,&amp;c.</p>
         <p>5. His country sav'd, the contest o'er, Sweet peace restor'd his toils to crown, The Warrior to his native shore Returns, and this his fertile ground. Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>7. But soon Columbia call'd him forth Again to save her sinking fame, To take the helm, and by his worth To make her an immortal name! Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>8. Nor yet alone thro' Paria's shores Her fame, her might trumpt blown; E'en Europe, Afric, Asia, hears, And emulate the deed he's done! Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>After which, the procession passed by the President, under the gallery, and then dispersed, highly satisfied with the occasion of their assembling, and fully participating in the joy of
            the day.</p>
         <p>The Independent Companies then escorted the President to his residence in Court-street–fired three vollies, and then dismissed.</p>
         <p>In the evening the several public houses in State-street were illuminated, the Coffee House, Bunch of Grapes, Eastern Coffee House, &amp;c. together, which mad a beautiful appearance.</p>
         <p>Fire works were also displayed in the said street.</p>
         <p>Rockets were likewise thrown from the French ships in the harbour, and from Castle William.</p>
         <p>Two French frigates, L'Active and Le Sensible, were delightfully illuminated, the former with several hundred lamps, judiciously arraigned.</p>
         <p>It is supposed the number assembled upon the above occasion, amounted to 24,000 persons. No unfavourable accident happened during the whole scene–that we have heard of.</p>
         <p>The regularity and good order in the procession afforded to the marhals the highest satisfaction, as well as to the numerous spectators.</p>

         <p>October 31. We are informed by very respectable authority, that Mr. M'Gillvry has written to the President of the United States, a full and sensible account of the rise and progress of the
            disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from which statement he expected to prove, to a demonstration, that he has not acted the inconsistent part which some have alleged, neither has
            there been such cruelties committed by the Indians.</p>
         <p>From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities, and considering he was educated in Europe, being the son of a Scotchman and Indian women, we have no reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of his
            people; but, on the contrary, it is rather to be presumed that his proposals, which are contained in his letter to the President, are of a rational nature, and many probably bring about a
            final and an advantageous treaty with the United States.</p>

         <p>November 12. On Thursday last the Viscount de Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of this town on board l'Illustre, of
            seventy-four guns. The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge, received the company at Foster's wharf, before 12 o'clock–and on the appearance of the first boat having ladies on
            board, a signal gun was fired from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations. On arriving at the ship, the company were very politely
            received by the Viscount, and conducted to the state room–the marines saluting as the company passed them. At one o'clock the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with a profusion of
            luxuries and delicacies, in a hall erected for the occasion, which was very fancifully decorated. At the head of the table was a castle of pastry, having thirteen metal guns, by which from
            tubes that communicated through the table, and the company were saluted with a f–deral discharge. On the top of the castle waved a small white ensign–the device, two hearts –the motto, "
            The United hearts of America and France." The head of the hall was ornamented with a heart pieced with arrows–and in the motton, " Homage to the fair daughters of America," a fine
            compliment made by the noble Viscount to his female guests. After dinner, the ball began, and closed before nine o'clock, and on departure, his Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets
            let off from a boat moored at some distance from the ship.</p>
         <p>Rhode Island and North Carolina yet remain averse to the new government; they refuse allegiance to all acts of the States, and, of course, do not participate in any privilee; they are
            treated in respect to port entries, &amp;c. as foreign States.</p>

         <p> By the last letters from India, we understand they were going on in the plodding way, with nothing new or important.–The markets are overstocked with British goods, so as to enable our
            countrymen to supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever,
            who is expected to remain another year among them, to the no small regret of those who left England for the sake of Oriental wealth.</p>
         <p>Our female adventurers have also found it a bad market ; British beauty never fails of finding its admirers ; but the late restriction in the East have rendered wives forbidden fruit, of
            which neither civil nor military dare to think of tasting.</p>

         <p>Character of the Female Sex. By Mr. Ledyard, a celebrated traveller.</p>
         <p>I have always remarked that women, in all countries, are civil, obliging, tender, and humane; that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheerful, timorous and modest : and that they do not
            hesitate, like men, to perform a generous action. Not haughty, not arrogant, not supercilious, they are full of courtesy, and fond of society ; more liable in general to err than man, but
            in general also more virtuous, and performing more good actions than he. To a woman, whether civilized or savage, I never addressed myself in the language of decency and friendship,
            without receiving a decent and friendly answer. With men it has been otherwise.</p>
         <p>In wandering over the barren plains of inhos- pitable Denmark, through honest Sweden and fro- zen Lapland, rude, and churlish Finland, unprin- cipled Russia, and the widespread regions of
            the wandering Tartar ; if hungry, dry, cold, wet, or sick, the women have ever been friendly to me, and uniformly so ; and to add to this virtue (so worthy the appellation of benevolence)
            these actions have been performed in so free and so kind a manner, that if I was dry I drank the sweetest draught, and if hungry I eat the coarse morsel with a double relish.</p>

         <p> We have this day received Quebec newspapers down to the 24th May, from which the following is extracted:–</p>
         <p>Quebec, May 20.</p>
         <p>We hear late accounts from Niagara mention, that the Indians in that quarter are much alarmed in consequence of a message said to be received by them from the States, that they had now
            raised an army to take their own for Niagara, and that two thousand men of that army were now on their way from New York–desiring the Indians to lye still and look on, and that they would
            punish those that should interfere.</p>
         <p>It was also said, that the people of New York were determined of themselves to lay open the post of Oswego, and that emissaries had been employed to persuade the Indians they would be
            greatly benefited by that event.</p>
         <p>We are rather inclined to believe the Indians are too sensible of the great benefits already conferred upon them by our neighbours in buying their lands from them, to think of accepting
            any more from that quarter, and we would recommend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this side the Atlantic, before they testify their impatience, that national treaties, like private
            agreements, are not to be infringed by one and performed by the other party–Pay and you shall receive.</p>
         <p>[As to the Americans making an attempt upon Niagara, they have long had it in contemplation to get possession of our posts upon the lakes in Canada.]</p>
         <p>May 24.</p>
         <p>The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop Washington, have received letters from the Captain Kendrick, dated at Nootka in July last; he informs them, that he passed the winter preceding
            on the north-west coast of America; that he was then bound on a voyage further northward, and from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– The letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spanish
            fleet that had been at Nootka, and from thence to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New York. They were covered to the President of the United States of America.</p>
         <p>[From what appeared in our paper of Friday last, (see Glasgow Intelligence, p. 424 ) and what is mentioned above, it seems very probable that the affair of Nootka Sound had been a
            preconcerted scheme between the Americans and Spaniards, as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for the President of the States without making the least mention (from what is made
            public) of any British ships being then at Nootka Sound.]</p>

         <p>By recent letters from America we learn, that the Congress of the nited States, after warm debates in both Houses, particularly in that of the Representatives, passed an act for the
            purpose of fixing permanently their seat of Government at German Town in Pennsylvania.</p>
         <p>The two new provinces in North America, Kentucky and Vermont, whose population already is so very considerable, were formed by the vast numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction
            and ravages of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and her colonies, and though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists, yet they have now jooined the American
            confederation. Seated on the banks of the great river Mississippi, far to the westward of all the other states, they can either navigate northerly to the lakes, or southerly to the Spanish
            settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and carry on a lucrative trade with the Indians. They are possessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world, the position of
            which they??? also s???d by navigable rivers to Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and from thence, as their views???tend, to every country in Europe. Thus, from the most distressed
            situation, to rise to opulence and independence ina few years, must excite admiration.</p>
         <p>Agriculture, at present, seems to be the peculiar province of American industry, from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country, as it abounds in large tracts of rich
            land, level grounds, with a deep soil, and extended savannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility; and though not so
            abundant in coin, yet the provinces produce the finest meadows, form whence a provision trade will be every year increasing. The southern countries of Europe, not affording sufficient
            crops of grain for the support of their inhabitants, on account of the remarkable encrease of population, and which is still augmenting, as arts and manufacturers are every where extended:
            America may, therefore, be deemed, in future, the granary of this quarter of the globe.</p>

         <p>A humorous Adventure of a Marriage negotiated by a Bill of Exchange, in one of the English West India Islands.</p>
         <p>A Merchant, originally from London, having acquired a great fortune in this island, concluded with himself he could not be happy in the enjoyment of it, unless[?] he shared[?] it with a
            woman of merit ; and knowing none to his fancy he resolved to write to a worthy correspondent of his in London. He know no other [?] than that he used in his trade ; therefore treating
            affairs of love as he did his business, after giving his friend in a letter several comissions, and reserving this for the last, he went on thus : Item[?], seeing that I have taken a
            resolution to marry, and that I do not find a suitable match for me here, do not fail to send me by next ship bound hither, a young woman of the qualifications and form following: As for a
            portion I demand none ; let her be of an honest family ; between 20 and 25 years of age ; of a middle stature, and well proportioned ; her face agreeable, her temper mild, her character
            blameless, her heatlh good, and her constitution strong enough to bear the change of the climate, that there may be no occasion to look out for a second through lack of the [?] soon after
            she comes to hand ; which must be provided against as much as possible, considering the great distance and dangers of the sea. If she arrives, and conditioned as abovesaid, with the
            present letter endorsed by you, or, at least, an attested copy thereof, that there may be no mistake or imposition, I hereby oblige and engage myself satisfy the said letter, by marrying
            the [?] at 15 days [?]. In witness [?] [?] I [?] [?], [?]."</p>
         <p>The London correspondent read over and over the odd article, which put the future [?] on the same footing with the bales of good he was to send to his friend ; and after adressing[?] the
            prudent exactness of the naturalized Creole, and his laconic stile, in enumerating the qualifications he insisted on, he endeavoured to serve him to his mind ; and after many enquiries, he
            judged he had found a lady fit for his purpose, in a young person of a reputable family, but no fortune ; of good humour, and of a polite education ; well shaped, and more than tolerably
            handsome. He made the proposal to her as his friend has directed, and the young gentlewoman, who had no subsistence but from a cross old aunt, who gave her a great deal of uneasiness,
            accepted it. A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board the same, together with the bales of goods, being well provided with all
            necessaries, and particularly with a certificate in due form, and indorsed by the correspondent. She was also included in the invoice, the last article of which ran thus : "Item, a maid of
            21 years of age, of the quality, shape and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the affadavits and certificates she has to produce." Writings, which were thought necessary to so exact
            a man as the future husband, were an extract from the parish register ; a certificate of her character, signified by the curate ; an attestation of her neighbours, setting forth that she
            had for the space of three years lived with an old aunt who was intolerably peevish, and that she had not, during all that time, given her said aunt, the least occasion of complaint. And
            li[?]y, the goodness of her consitution was certified after [?] by [?] [?]. [?] [?] departure the London correspondent sent several letters of advice by other ships to his friend, whereby
            he informed him that per such a [?] he sent him a young woman of such an age, character, and condition &amp;c. in a word, such [?] desired to marry. The letters of advice, the bales, and
            the gentlewoman came safe to the port ; and our Creole, who happened to be one[?] of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing was charmed to see a handsome person, who having heard
            him called by his name, told him, "Sir, I have a bill of exchange upon you, and you know that it is not usually for people to carry a great deal of money about them in such a long voyage
            as I have made ; I beg the favour you will pleased to pay it." At the same time she gave him his correspondent's letter, on the back of which was wrote, " The bearer of this is the spouse
            you ordered me to send you." Ha, [?][?] ! said the Creole, I never yet suffered my bills to be protested, and I swear this shall not be the first : I shall reckon myself the most fortunate
            of all men, if you allow me to discharge it." Yes, Sir, replied she, and the more willingly, since I am apprized of your character. We have several persons of honour on board, who knew you
            very well, and who, during my passage have answered all the questions I asked them concerning you, in so advantageous a manner, that it has raised in me [?] for you." This first interview
            was in a few days after followed by the nuptials, which were very magnificent. The new married couple are satisfied with their happy union made by [?] of exchange, which was the most
            fortunate that had happened in that island for many years.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from New York, Aug. 3.</p>
         <p>"Our harvest is over westward and through the southern counties of this State. This week will finish it in the northern, and I am confident we have not had so fine a crop since 1774, and
            all gathered without a drop of rain, which will render wheat fit for exportation in OCtober. The Summer grains are also abundant, and those on the ground, especially Indian corn, equally
            promising. Should Europe require wheat at even two thirds of the prices given last year, we shall draw a very large balance from them in specie.</p>
         <p>The public debt of this country having in course of a few days been funded, brought many foreigners into deep speculations, which reduced bills of exchange to par.</p>

         <p>A Transfer of Conjugal Love.</p>
         <p>On Monday last was married at Stockport, an inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a female on whom he had fixed his affections. It is to be observed, that he did not toil through the tedious
            forms of courtship, but at once got a wife, as others sometimes get good places, by purchase –and, as we are informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas and thirty yards of Irish cloth,
            at 2s. 6d. per yard–which property he deposited in exchange for earthly treasure. –Whether a wife may be cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her former husband, having seen
            military service, was not to be discomposed at trifles, and his philosophy probably being strengthened on the occasion, he attended the happy pair to church, and saw the marriage ceremony
            ; after which they spent the evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was gaity. The first husband parted with an helpmate had borne his sorrows twelve years ; and the second husband
            received a partner of his joys, after having buried a former one just a week.</p>

         <p>Court of Chancery. The King, at the relation of the Bishop of London , versus Anderson and Gipps.</p>
         <p>On the 18th of June, 1692, the Hon. Mr. Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid out in lands in Yorkshire, out of the rents of which the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the
            College of William and Mary, in New England, to be applied for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back settlements in North America ; and likewise
            a further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College, for the support of two missionaries to preach the gospel. The city of London were left trustees, and the management under the trust
            was, by the will, committed to the care of the Bishop of London. The present Bishop instituted this suit, in which the city, and a great number of other persons, were parties, for the
            single, and indeed novel purpose of knowing, whether (as the teststor had originally devised the several sums for the use of British subjects, and the Americans having ceased to be in that
            situations since their independence), the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom, or to some other of his Majesty's colonies, to be applied to similar purposes. This being the first
            determination of that nature since the American Revolution, the Lord Chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that always attends his decrees. Two phrases are
            sufficient– "all charitable devices are to be held sacred– we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead, in search of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears must be paid, and Messrs.
            Anderson and Gipps, and likewise the city of London, must be paid their costs."</p>

         <p> JULY the twenty-seventh day My wife Betsey ran away From bed and board,–and this did say, "She would no longer with me stay." Since she has left me without cause I'll give her time enough
            to pause. That she may see her grievous error, When I live happy with a fairer. So I forewarn both great and small To trust her any thing at all, For of her contracts from this day One

         <p>On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's, which they explain with an equal degree of curiosity and</p>
         <p>amazement. They were asked whether they would not attend the evening service, which they readily complied, and seemed particularly delighted with the organ.</p>
         <p>The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer of 20,000 men, gratitude obliges us to make them some acknowledgement, whether we accept their offer or not.–We can very well spare them the
            members of the Halter Club,–all our housebreakers, highwaymen, pick pockets, swindlers, Faro and E O Table keepers,–and all their accomplices to an amazing number.</p>
         <p>Such a collection would be a truly valuable present.–Among them are found dispersedly all the qualities of able Generals,–skilful Financiers, –able Negotiators, active Citizens,–and men
            highly expert at a Coup de Main.</p>
         <p>Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe,–the Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their own country enter into a boxing war against their enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant
            success.</p>
         <p>Trading Justices and Lawyers they would perhaps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of most people, that a few thousands of the latter description of men might be spared.</p>

         <p>By letters from the New York Packet, dated October 6, from Philadelphia, we learn that there has been a very fine harvest in the Southern States, and that the wheat has been wonderfully
            productive. A very large quantity had been bought up for the Spanish markets. The quality of European goods, imported the last season was immense, goods selling for considerable loss ; and
            such will always be the case when the Merchants in England anticipate a ray of fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The appearance of a Spanish war had given them great prospects of
            commercial advantages, and a seven years war is what the Americans were all earnestly wishing for.</p>

         <p>When the Cherokee Chiefs first visited Coventgarden Theatre, one of them appeared much delighted with the splendid appearance of an Indian cap worn by one of the pantomime actors; this
            being observed, the performer was directed the performance; the Chief, amazed at the offer of the magnificent present, said, through his interpreter, " that even in his won country he
            should be unable to repay it ; however, at present he would do the utmost in his power ;" on this he ordered the actor to approach him, and then lighting his Cherokee pipe stuffed with a
            variety of nauseous combustibles, he too three whiffs himself, and presenting the tube, desired the actor to take three whiffs also–the greatest favour a Cherokee could confer ; the actor,
            aastonished at the singularity of this unexpected honour, reluctantly complied with the request,to the great entertainment of the Dramatic circle.</p>

         <p>DOMINICA.St. Pierre, Martinico, Sept. 11</p>
         <p>This Colony is in a perfect state of anarchy ; is so much that we have had thoughts of quitting the island, and going to Trinidad, taking the negroes with us. Unless some speedy and
            effectual succours arrive, the colony is utterly ruined. The greater part of the colonists, this day, assembled at Gros-morne.–The grenadiers, who were in the fort of Trinity, with twenty
            three officers of the regiment, were glad to make their escape.– There are 1500 men in the FOrt Bourbon, many of whom are from Dominica, Guadaloupe, and other colonies, an supposed to have
            been sent by Martinico refugees.–The firing of cannon is heard incessantly ; at this rate the magazine of powder will soon be consumed.</p>
         <p>The Municipality of Fort Royal, have been obliged to promise and sign whatever the insurgents have been please to dictate.–The soldiers run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to
            give them money.–Imagine, in short, a scene of confusion and terror, and you will then have some idea of the persent [?] of Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal.</p>
         <p>The town of St. Pierre swarms with strangers, who come here from all parts. M. Chabrol, Colonel of the regiment which has been sent here, together with a company of Chaffeurs, has been
            appointed comandant o the NAtional troops.</p>
         <p>The women, confident that it is in his power to re-establish tranquility, prostrate themselves before him, strew the ground on which he walks with flowers, and affectionately embrace him.–
            He seems willing to comply with their wishes.</p>
         <p>The Colonial Assembly sits at Gros-morne guarded by an army of 4000 men, under the command of M. Dumoise, appointed by the General.</p>
         <p>We are assured, that the insurgents are arming four privateers with which they mean to attack Trinity. Some soldiers attempted to penetrate among them, but were repulsed by the
            Mulattoes.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Dublin, Nov. 23.</p>
         <p>"The drafts at Cork yesterday received the agreeable orders to return to their respective regiments immediately.</p>
         <p>"The officers appointed to raise independent companies in Ireland, have received orders to repair forthwith to England, with whatever complement of men already entered, but not to proceed
            with the completion of their number : in conference to this order, they are preparing for their immediate departure.</p>
         <p>"Last Tuesday two eminent merchants of this city received orders, by way of a vessel arrived at Cork, from Mess de Fouseca Olivarez and Co. at Seville, for the immediate exportation of
            cotton, white linen, and mixed goods, to a very large amount.</p>
         <p>"Monday evening the Elizabeth and Mary, Mark Purcell, master, arrived at Waterford from Annapolis, in Maryland, after a long and dangerous passage, of 52 days, in which they had nearly
            exhausted the whole of their provisions, having been a very short allowance of half a naggin of rum, diluted with one pint of bad water, for twenty-four hours. She is heavy laden, having
            on board six hundread hogsheads of tobacco, a large quantity of pipe staves, barrel hoops, &amp;c. and has been expected more than two months. Eight per cent was offered as insurance on
            ship and cargo, but refused, on account of the then probability of a war."</p>

         <p>THE INDIANS.</p>
         <p> IT is our wish, in imitation of other newswritters, to give now and then an account of such new publications as deserve the attention of the public; but in a paper, published only twice a
            week, where so much naturally occurs under the article of temporary news, it is but seldom we can find room for this purpose:–when, however, any ting remarkable appears in the literary
            world, we never fail to notice it, although it may not be in our power to give an extensive and critical account of its excellencies. We take up the pen with real pleasure at present to
            announce the publication of a tragedy, intitled THE INDIANS, the reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this University. The great applause with which this play was received, when
            performed at Richmond Theatre, has raised the expectations of those who were not present at the performance to the highest pitch; and we think we may take upon ourselves to assert, that
            upon perusing it, even their highest expetations will not be disappointed.– The plot of the piece is taken from a well known story published at the end of a volum of poems, written by the
            same gentleman. In the choice of a plot, where so many dramatic writers of respectable talents have erred, our author is peculiarly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of Horace:</p>
         <p>Denique sit quid vis, simplex dumtaxat et unum.</p>
         <p>It is simple, and yet it does not disgust by an appearance of nakedness.–It is one, for the complaints of Maraino, and the return of Oniyo, form a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and
            Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and defeat of those arts, an end, which combined wake up a compleat and connected whole. In the delineation of character the author has, on
            alevery occasion, attended to the " quid quemque decent "–there are hoever some few parts, which the critic halts to consider, but which amidst so many beauties, he blushes to censure–Some
            lines, for instance in the character of Ononthio, do not strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem, as to prompt him to spare a
            victim, about to be destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; that victim a captive of war, and not only so, but a Briton, who has been fighting against his countrymen, amongst
            whom was his only son, whom he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much in favour of a stranger and a foe, at the risk of displeasing the village, and consequently of losing his
            power? Or is it likely that he would have greater influence with the superstitious crowd, than he, who was deemed of skill to bend to his purpose the demons that sway the fortune of
            mankind?–Another question concenring Ononthio, and we leave him. Is it consistent with the philosophic firmness of the Sachem, so to despair on receiving news of his son's death, as to
            declare that he should know no comfort, but to die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave Maraino at such a period of distress, when she most stood in need of his kind
            offices?–The first, and best supported character in the piece is that of Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence of Ononthio, her
            unaffected piety, and her humanity, in interfering to save an unknown captive from death, are pleasing??? which give???an insight into her nature. In the breast of Mariano every thing is
            subordinate to her love for Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is properly kept in view during the course of the piece. But even in this master-piece the author, has, perhaps,
            once deviated a little from nature. The sentiments Maraino utters during the conversation with Sydney, in the fifth act, are rather those of a Phiosopher and Divine, than a young creature,
            the chorus of whole heart are tuned to the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can she, who had lately discovered a long lost brother, talk so coldly in his presence; Can she, who had
            so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband, so entirely banish his image from her mind, as to converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gentle Maraino become the cold
            moralist?–With this one exception, the part of which we are speaking is finely drawn and highly interesting.–The language of the piece is every where elegant, and in many places, where the
            sentiment requires it, sublime. The author has frequently dignified his verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this in general produces a good effect–but there is a danger of using
            them too often, and of chusing them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult talk where all is so excellent, to refer to any particular passage of scene as deserving most notice: it
            requires no small degree of taste and judgement. If there is any preference to be given, it is perhaps to that scene in the 2d act, where Onaiyo gives an account of the battle at Quebec;
            and the scene in the 4th act, where Maraino is prompted by Neidan to slay her brother,–who proves his innocence by the production of her husband's belt, the sight of which draws an elegant
            speech from the enraptured fair. This scene, however, would be improved did it conclude with something more apt to the joyful moment, than the solemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent
            in itself, and containing a very fine sentiment, Sed nunc non erat his locus.–</p>
         <p>Upon the whole, the tragedy, upon which we have, guided by impartiality, spoken so freely, is in our opinion far superior to most of those plays which have appeared of late years:–it is
            devoid of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevitably please.</p>

         <p>Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, says that the Indians in Washington county commit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. They have set fire to several houses; and a woman,
            who had a sick husband, telling them from a window, of her calamity, they shot her dead on the spot, and then set fire to the spot. The sick man was consequently burnt.</p>
         <p>A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and distinguished himself in opposing the Indians on a part of the American frontiers. This gentleman, with two hundred men, even went into the very
            heart of an Indian settlement, and defeated the savages. He then penetrated the country, destroying all before him, and returned without the loss of a man. Every possible acknowledgement
            was made of his services and bravery, and a liberal subscription made for his gallant little army.</p>

         <p>QUEBEC, December 2, 1790 Yesterday's post from Montreal, conveyed letters to several gentlemen in town, all corroboratiing the following extract.</p>
         <p>" SIR, "I have to inform you by several letters received here on Saturday from Detroit, "we are informed the Americans, under General Sinclair, had been twice defeated, about the 19th ult.
            with the loss of from 500 to 600 men, by the Indians The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse which they had drawn into a snare, and cut the whole of them off. In a second
            engagement, they were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as many. On account of which, Sinclair thought proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the Indians having divided
            themselves into small parties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper. It is said the Indians
            are very much elated at their success, and that numbers were daily joining them, at their head quarters, about the Maimis towns– One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own hand.</p>
         <p>"The Indians were extremely civil to the traders from Detriot, having assisted them, when they knew of the approach of the Americans, to remove their property to safety, except ammunition
            and arms. These are facts so well ascertained, that there does not remain the least doubt of them:</p>
         <p>They may be attended with very serious and important consequences to the province, as I dare say, all will be imputed to the British for supplying these Indians with arms and ammunition.–
            In short, I would not be surprized to hear of an American army raising, to attack this country. * The loss is here specified, but other letters differing in number, we shall only say, the
            estimate in general does not appear considerable.</p>

         <p>Longevity. –At Taconey, a small village about seven miles from Philadelphia, there is now living a shoemaker of the name of Robert Glen, who in December last attained the great age of one
            hun - dred and fourteen years. Scotland was the place of his nativity; he remembers having seen King William III. and was present at the two succeeding coronations. Neither his memory nor
            his sight, are in the least impaired; and such is his strength, that after working all the week at his profession, he regularly walks on Sunday to Philadelphia, and back. His third wife is
            now living, and is not more than thirty years old.</p>

         <p> CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</p>
         <p>The following account of the inhabitants of this settlement is given by a late traveller.</p>
         <p>The education of youth has hitherto been very much neglected: the government never hit upon any successful plan for the establishment of public schools; and the individual had no other
            ambition but that of qualifying his sons, by writing and accounts, to become servants of the Company. This body of merchants had a number of persons in their employ, who were very ill
            paid. Their salaries, indeed, were sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it tacitly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the consequence of such a conduct was, that each
            became a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little private shop in some corner of his house. The most paltry articles were in the list of their commodities for sale ; and those who ranked
            high in government, and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to their names, felt no sore of indignity in retailing the produce of their gardens ; not indeed, avowedly, but through
            the medium of their slaves. In fact, the minds of every class, the Governor, the Clergy, the F[?]l, and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted, were wholly bent on trade. Knopman,
            or merchant, was a title that conferred rank at the Cape, to which the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chinese, who have
            degraded the merchant into the very lowest order of their society.</p>
         <p>That portion of the day, not employed in the concerns of trade, is usually devoted to the gratification of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste for reading, and none for the
            cultivation of the fine arts.–They have no kind of public amusements, except occasional balls ; nor is there much social intercourse but by family parties; which usually consist of card
            playing or dancing. Money-matters and merchandize engross their whole conversation : yet none are opulent, though many in easy circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole colony, and
            but a few who are objects of public charity. The subsistence for these is derived from the interest of a fund established out of the church superfluities, from alms, donations, and
            collections, made after divine service, and not from any tax laid upon the public. Except, indeed, a few colonial assessments for the repairs of the streets and public works, the
            inhabitants of the Cape have little drawback on their profits, on the produce of their labour.</p>
         <p>It has been the remark of most travellers, that the ladies of the Cape are pretty, lively, and good humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic temper which is a principal trait in the
            national character of the Dutch. The difference in the manners and appearance of the young men and the young women, in the same family, is inconceivably great. The former are clumsy in
            their shape, awkward in in their carriage, and of an unsocial disposition; whilst the latter are generally of a small, delicate form, below the middle size, of easy and unaffected manners,
            well dressed, and fond of social intercourse; an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained by their parents, and which they as seldom turn to abuse. They are here indeed less
            dependent on, and less subject to, the caprice of parents than else where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; but all the children, male and female, share alike in the family
            property. No parent can disinherit a child without assigning, on proof, on at least of the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian Code.</p>
         <p>By the law of the colony, a community of all property, both real and personal, is supposed to take place on the marriage of two person unless the contrary should be particularly provided
            against by solemn contract made before marriage. Where no such contract exists, the children, on the death of either parent, are entitled to that half of the joint property, which was
            supposed to belong to the deceased, and which cannot be withheld on application after they are come of age.</p>
         <p>It is but justice to the young females of the Cape to r emark, that many of them have profited much more than could be expected from the limited means of education that the place affords.
            In the better families, most of them are taught music, and some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. Many understand the French language, and some have made great proficiency in
            the English. They are expert at the needle, and all kinds of lace, knotting, and tambour work, and in general make up their own dresses, following the prevailing fashion of England brought
            from time to time by the female passengers bound to India, from whom they may be said to "Catch the manners living as they rise"</p>
         <p>Neither are the other sex, while boys, deficient in vivacity or talent ; but, for want of the means of a proper education, to open their minds, and excite in them a desire of knowledge,
            they soon degenerate into the common routine of eating, smoaking [sic], and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate with the English, except such as hold employments under the
            Government. This backwardness may be said to be owing in part to the different habits of the two nations, and partly, perhaps, to the reluctance that a vanquished people must always feel
            in mixing with their conquerors.</p>

         <p>As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York, Nov. 6 1792, gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country, we are
            persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers.</p>
         <p>Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives,</p>
         <p>IT is some abatement of the satisfaction, with which I meet you on the present occasion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity, generally, I am not able to
            add to it information that the Indian hostilities, which have for some time past, distressed our western frontier, have terminated:</p>
         <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less concern, than I communicate it, that reiterated endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous
            proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to
            arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation, for peace, has led to strenuous efforts, through various channels, to accomplish these desirable purposes:–In
            making which efforts, I consulted less my own anticipations of the event, or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the object attainable;
            to ascertain, unequivocally, that such is the case.</p>
         <p>A detail of the measures which have been pursued, and of their consequences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of success, thus far, will, I trust,
            evince that means, as proper and as efficacious, as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; but a favorable one, though not to be
            despaired of, is not promised by anything that has yet happened.</p>
         <p>In the course of the attempts, which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected, even among savages, has
            been found, in this instance, insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will, I presume, be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of
            liberality towards the families of the deceased.</p>
         <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threatening symptoms have of late been revived
            among some of those south of it.</p>
         <p>A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River, have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring
            settlements.</p>
         <p>It was hoped that the treaty of Holston, made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The
            Chickamagas, aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities, upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter.
            The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed.</p>
         <p>It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever, on the part of the United States or their citizens, is even alleged, as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in
            this quarter.</p>
         <p>I have reason to believe, that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war,
            in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited, though the number is still incomplete, and pains have been
            taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards
            a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement, from the proper department, with regard to the number of troops raised, and some
            other points which have been suggested, will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things, will enable Congress to judge whether some
            additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.</p>
         <p>In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable, I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the
            present year, is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community, for the service of the ensuing year. This however, will be better ascertained in the course of
            the session; and it is proper to add, that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities.</p>
         <p>I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our
            interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by competent rewards, the employment of
            qualified and trusty persons to reside among them, as agents, would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients, an eligible
            plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants, and under regulations calculated to
            protect them from imposition and extortion, its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.</p>
         <p>The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be still more the case, were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the
            duties on spirits, distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened, and are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at large, the contentment with the
            law appears to be progressive.</p>
         <p>But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters, I judged a special interposition on my part, proper and advisable, and under this impression
            have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings, having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question, and announcing
            that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.</p>
         <p>Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me, shall be wanting
            to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the
            zealous support of all good citizens.</p>
         <p>I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court, which will be
            laid before you, points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system, which in
            some cases, tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject, provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States, and a
            supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union, and of the punishment for such offenses will, it is presumed, be found worthy of particular
            attention.</p>
         <p>Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise, however, by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to
            disturb it, and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations, which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your
            consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations, and other infractions of the law of nations, which furnishes just subject of
            complaint, might endanger our peace with them. And, in general, the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the
            law for that purpose, which takes place, if not renewed, at the close of the present session.</p>
         <p>In execution of the authority given by the legislature, measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at
            home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings, and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in
            the coinage of half dimes, the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.</p>
         <p>The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage, as being essential to their due operation, and to order in our money concerns, will, I doubt
            not, be resumed and completed.</p>
         <p>It is represented that some provisions in the law, which establishes the Post-Office, operate, in experiment, against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should
            this, upon due enquiry, be found to be the fact, a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor</p>
         <p>mation, will, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy.</p>
         <p>The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky, has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the
            happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates, and conducive to the general order.</p>
         <p>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since my last communication on the subject, and in further execution of the acts, severally making provision for the public debt, and for the
            reduction thereof, three new loans have been effected, each for three millions of florins,–one at Antwerp, at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four
            per cent. in lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans, and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.</p>
         <p>Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied, the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers, according to the provision made during the last session,
            has been embraced.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.</p>
         <p>I entertain a strong hope, that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption
            and discharge of the public debt, according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable, whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic
            importance, or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation.</p>
         <p>Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In
            fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, it is expected a valuable saving will be made.</p>
         <p>Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision, will demand, and I doubt not will engage, your early attention.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.</p>
         <p>I content myself with recalling your attention, generally to such objects, not particularized in my present, as have been suggested in my former communications to you.</p>
         <p>Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these, that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, will merit particular notice.</p>
         <p>The results of your common deliberations hitherto will, I trust, be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as, by conciliating more and more their ultimate
            suffrage, will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment, upon which, under Divine Providence, materially depend their union, their safety, and their happiness.</p>
         <p>Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful cultivation of harmony, combined with a due regard to
            stability, in the public councils.</p>

         <p>Philadelphia, June 1.</p>
         <p>We are informed that in consequence of instructions from the Executive Council of the United States to the Attorney for the District of Penn sylvania, prosecutions have been instituted
            against John Singleterry and Gideon Henfield, charged with violating their duty as Citizens of the United States, entering on board the armed schooner Genet, in the service of France, and,
            with others on board the said schooner, capturing several vessels, the property of the subjects of his Britannic Majesty, and otherwise annoying the trade and commerce of the said
            subjects, contrary to the Laws of Nations, and the Treaty of Peace subsisting between the United States and his said Britannic Majesty.</p>
         <p>The above named persons have been committed to the goal of the County of Philadelphia, to take their trial at the next Circuit Court of the United States.</p>
         <p>"A letter from Charleston, dated May 10, says "Yesterday evening a gentleman arrived here from Augusta, in Georgia, who informs, that six of the Creek Towns, with a number of Cherokees,
            had declared war against the United States, and were actually marching under the command of Bowles and Gilpin, at attack the frontiers."</p>

         <p>Knoxville, May 11.</p>
         <p>I T is shocking to describe the bloody scenes that have lately taken place in this district. The Indians have killed and scalped a great number of persons, among whom is Colonel Isaac
            Bledose, who was massacred within 150 yards of his own house.</p>
         <p>On the 27th instant a body of Indians attacked Greenfield station: they killed John Jervis, and a negro fellow, belonging to Mrs. Tarker. By the bravery of three young men, viz. William
            Neely, William Wilson, and William Hall, the station was preserved; they killed two Indians, wounded several others, and put them to flight. It is to be remembered, that Neely and Hall had
            each lost a father and two brothers, and Wilson a brother, by the savages. Men are now in pursuit of the Indians.</p>
         <p>June 15.</p>
         <p>About the 5th instant, a company of seven men were attacked on the trace from Cumberland to Kentucky, near Big Barren, by a party of Indians; three of the company were killed, and two
            wounded.</p>
         <p> AUGUSTA, June 15. Advices from our western frontiers mention, that Major General Twiggs crossed the Oconnee with about 900 men, on Saturday last, on their way to the Cakmulgee, where the
            infantry were to halt and build a fort. The cavalry, amounting to 450, commanded by Brigadier Generals Irwin, Clark, and Blackburn, were immediately to proceed to the lower Creek towns,
            and procure satisfaction for the numerous unprovoked murders and devastations lately committed by that faithless tribe of savages.</p>
         <p>Brigadier General Glascock, we are informed, has received orders from the Commander in Chief to march to the frontiers in a few days, with one- third of his brigade, and part of the
            Augusta artillery.</p>

         <p>New South Wales</p>
         <p>The following particulars respecting this flourishing colony will not be unacceptable to our readers :–</p>
         <p>"We are informed by Lieutenant Grant, who is lately arrived from New South Wales, of the flourishing state of that colony ; he left Port Jackson in November last, when the crops were very
            luxuriant and beginning to be cut down, without having suffered that year from the floods.</p>
         <p>"Governor King had opened a communication with Otaheite, for the purpose of supplying the colony with pork, in which he had been singularly successful his Majesty's armed ship Porpoise
            having made one trip, and the Norfolk brig having sailed on the same employ previous to Mr Grant's leaving Sydney.</p>
         <p>"The most friendly understanding exists between the natives of Otaheite and the settlement of New South Wales. We are happy to hear that the latter country is longer in want of a staple
            commodity, the article of coals, of an excellent kind, being found in abundance in Hunter's River, together with plenty of wood, well qualified for the masting of shipping. Mr Grant made
            his passage to the Cape of Good Hope, round Cape Horn, in the brig Anna Josepha, loaded with spars for masts, and coals, which latter sold immediately at the Cape, at 36 rix dollars per
            ton (nearly 6l. sterling.)</p>
         <p>"Governor King had formed a small settlement at Hunter's River, for the purpose of working the coal, which is of the same nature with that of Newcastle.</p>
         <p>"Mr Grant entered this river in the Lady Nelson, in order to obtain the survey of it. He penetrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up the same, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel
            Paterson, without being able at that time, to discover its source. A wood resemblingsustichad also been found.</p>
         <p>"Mr Grant in his passage from England to Port Jackson, in the Lady Nelson, a vessel of only 60 tons burthen, with three sliding keels, and built on Captain Schank's construction, was the
            first that passed through the straits which separate Van Diemens Land from New Holland, and sailed along a great extent of coast to the westward of any land before seen by those who had
            visited that country, going into no higher latitude than 39. 30. fourth ; and observes, that the fourth cape of New Holland lies in 39. 2. fourth. He found those he sailed along bold, with
            very deep water, wherever he attempted to land ; and, in general, he had, with a very moderate offing, from 50 10 45, and 30 fathoms water, fine land, and sometimes shells.</p>
         <p>"By order of Governor King, he returned into those straits, and obtained the survey of the coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port, with the survey of that harbour, which is well
            sheltered, and capable of containing many sail of shipping. There is abundance of wood easily to be got, and plenty of water ; though the latter is rather difficult to be procured, on
            account of the distance, and from several shoals lying in the way, which render it necessary to take advantage of tide. Mr Grant gives a very favourable report of that part of the
            country.</p>

         <p>Canada Extract of a letter from a Gentleman, to his Friend in Glasgow</p>
         <p>" Quebec, March 23, 1810.–A number of leading characters among the Canadians, who were Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissolved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a
            French paper, called La Canadien, have been arrested and thrown into jail, upon a charge of treasonable and seditious practises ; the printing press, types, &amp;c. also taken possession
            of. This vigorous measure of Sir James Craig, has astonished the Canadians not a little, but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country, as it has crushed a faction which
            has for some years been gaining strength, and acquiring dangerous influence over the minds of the inhabitants, who are without education, and ignorant, of course, in the extreme ;
            therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen, who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the
            British : for, having been allowed to preserve their language, they are nearly as much Frenchmen now as they were at the conquest."</p>
         <p>Quebec, March 22.–On Sunday afternoon, the printer of the Canadien, Mr Charles Lafrancois was arrested and committed to jail, under a warrant from the Executive Council, on a charge of
            treasonable practises. On Monday evening, Dr Blanchet and Mr Bedard, and last evening Mr T. Taschereau, were also arrested, and committed by the same authority on the same charges.</p>
         <p>The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an elegant dinner, at head-quarters, on the 4th curt. to celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of the Nobility and Gentry, Generals,
            and Field-Officers of the army, were present.</p>
         <p>Among the other accidents that occurred on the King's birth-day, from the imprudent use of gunpowder, is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– Her clothes were set fire by a squib, and,
            although immediately taken to the Infirmary, was so severely burnt, that she died before morning.</p>
         <p>A very melancholy accident happened at a place called the Pease, Berwickshire. As one of the baggage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping there, a fine boy about eight years of
            age, belonging to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and was climbing on the wheel, when the horses suddengoing off, threw him on the ground, and the wheel passing over his body,
            crushed him to death. The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident happened.</p>
         <p>On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, Glasgow, was broken into and about five pounds in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight shillings of copper, a counterfeit
            half-guinea, and a pocket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; some partial payments are marked on the bills. The villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing up the
            window shutter with an iron bar, and then breaking a pane of glass, by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened.</p>
         <p>On Saturday last, a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pully was supported, giving way, the
            measure fell down upon him, and killed him instantly.</p>
         <p>A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Stevenson, was killed by the blowing up of some stones, at Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse. The match unfortunately communicated too early
            to the powder, and the explosion took place before he could get out of the way. He has left a wife and two children to lament his loss.</p>

         <p>Montreal, July 4</p>
         <p>This city has been for a few days past in a state of agitation occasioned by an event which has taken place at Pointe Claire ; and as this matter will be clothed, no doubt, in all the
            dress of misrepresentatation by our neighbouring enemies, from the information they may receive of it, we consider it a duty, we owe to the community at large in this country, to state the
            circumstances as they occurred, in a fair, open, and candid manner.</p>
         <p>By the late militia law, 2000 young men are to be drafted from the general militia of the province for three months to be properly trained, and of course, a certain proportion of this
            number is to be furnished by each particular district. Some those drafted from the Parish of Pointe Claire refused to march to Lapraire, for the purpose of joining the division stationed
            there ; in consequence of which, Major, Leprohon, belonging to this particular battalion, was sent on Tuesday last, with 22 attendants, to apprehend these refractory persons as
            deserters.</p>
         <p>They apprehended four with some opposition ; and on their way to town with them, they were followed by a considerable number of persons who rescued one prisoner, and threatened that they
            would next day proceed to the depot at Lapraire, and bring away by force from thence the young men of the parish, who were there on duty. Accordingly, on Wednesday, a large body of these
            people assembled at La Chine, with the intention of carrying their threats into execution.</p>
         <p>Thomas M'Cord, Esq. one of the Police Magistrates, about four o'clock in the afternoon, left town, accompanied by the light infantry of the 49th regiment, and a detachment of the royal
            artillery, with two field-pieces, under the command of Major Plenderleath, and took post on a point opposite to the insurgents (consisting of about 400 persons, 87 of whom appeared to be
            armed) and at the distance[?] of about two acres. Mr M'Cord, with some other respectable citizens, pointed out the impropriety of their conduct, and the fate that would unfortunately await
            their perseverance ; urging them, by every persuasion, to disperse and return peaceably to their horses and obey the law.</p>
         <p>They replied, that they did not consider the militia bill as fully passed–that they were informed it had not received the Royal sanction ; and that although it might have passed the House
            of Assembly, where it originated, it had not obtained the approbation of the other branches of the Legislate ; that the law, if really enacted, had not been promagated amongst them, and
            that they were not properly made acquainted with it ; as such, they could not pay obedience to it.</p>
         <p>Under this false and unfortunate impression, these deluded people persisted ; but at the same time declared, with shouts of Vive le Roi that if the Government wanted their services at any
            time, they were ready, one and all, to come forward with their lives in the defence of their country, and that they would prove themselves, in the hour of danger, to be faithful subjects
            to a Government to which they were firmly attached by every principle.</p>
         <p>Finding, however, that they still persisted in their determination on this particular object, Mr M'Cord, in his Magisterial capacity, read the riot act to them and ordered them to disperse
            ; which not being complied with, a round shot was fired by the artillery, but elevated above injury, which was returned by the insurgents in a spirited fire with ball, deserving of a
            better cause. The troops then fired a volley with ball and grape, but still too much elevated to do any harm which was also returned by another discharge from the mob, upon which a few
            direct shots were fired at them (it being nearly dark) by the military, which made them disperse, and one man was found killed and another wounded, it is feared mortally.</p>

         <p>Upper Canada York, July, 28.</p>
         <p>Yesterday, at an early hour, his Honour, Isaac Brock, Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada, and Major-General, commanding his Majesty's forces therein, arrived at this place
            from Fort-George, and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature, and delivered the
            following speech to both houses :–</p>
         <p>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature, Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly,</p>
         <p>"The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together, at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care
            and attention.</p>
         <p>"But, Gentlemen, when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province, the voice of loyalty, as well as of interest, calls aloud to every person, in the
            sphere in which he is placed, to defend his country.</p>
         <p>"Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced, by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct, that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the
            constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction, that, while I address you as Legislators, I speak to mean who, in the day of danger, will be ready to assist, not
            only with their counsels, but with their arms.</p>
         <p>"We look, Gentlemen, to our militia, as well as to the regular forces, for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care, if I attempted to conceal
            (what experience, the great instructor of mankind, especially of legislators, has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to
            consider what further improvements they still may require.</p>
         <p>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly,</p>
         <p>"From the history and experience of our mother country, we learn, that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to
            secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery, as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining, for a
            limited period, the liberty of individuals, in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might
            justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency, yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses.</p>
         <p>"A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of
            loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province, is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected,
            I am convinced, are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations, is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations."</p>
         <p>The speech concludes with a call for supplies.</p>
         <p>Proclamation</p>
         <p>The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America, against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and its dependencies, has been followed by the actual invasion
            of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts, by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's
            subjects, not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission, but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government.</p>
         <p>Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada, on the administration of his Majesty, every
            inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject, who can truly affirm
            to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person, his property, or his liberty? Where is to be found, in any part of the world, a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth
            as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans, exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty, not a descendant of these brave people it to be
            found, who, under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign, has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment, superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled
            prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government, or the persevering industry of the people, had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to
            its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain, must be the loss
            of this inestimable advantage, and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States, and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of
            their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious, that once exchanged from the powerful protection of
            the United Kingdom, you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France, from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure,
            from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France, was the stipulated reward for the
            aid afforded to the revolted colonies, now the United States ; the debt is still due, and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial
            advantages, or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared, inhabitants of Canada, to become willing subjects, or rather slaves
            to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not, arise in a body, exert your energies, co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces, to repel the invader,
            and do not give cause to your children, when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master, to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a
            participation in the name, character, and freedom of Britain.</p>
         <p>[The proclamation concludes with a declaration, that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks, that a severe and rigorous retaliation
            will take place.]</p>
         <p>Isaac Brock, Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters, Fort George, July 22, 1812.</p>

         <p>Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada Legislative Council –Aug 1.</p>
         <p>This day at two o'clock, his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber, and being seated on the Throne, the Gentlemen Usher of the Black
            Rod was sent to command the presence of the Assembly, which being come up, the Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said–</p>
         <p>"May it please your Excellency,</p>
         <p>"His Majesty's faithful subjects, the representatives of the province of Lower Canada, have passed a bill, intituled, "An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills." Their loyalty,
            and the happiness of this province in being connected with, and powerfully protected by the British nation, are the basis of their constitution, and the just grounds which gave rise to the
            formation of the militia, and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the United States have lately declared ; they are, therefore, under
            the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions, on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years, the punctual payment of the army,
            by circulating bills, the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them greater credit, the bill limits the sums necessary, and, moreover, provides for the interest, the
            advantages accruing therefrom, and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province, which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period, to any person
            whatever, who, from the state of his private affairs, would prefer such payment.</p>
         <p>"In full confidence that, under the present and any unforeseen circumstance, your Excellency is invested with all necessary authority, the representatives of the province and their
            constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration, and in the name of the Commons of Lower Canada, I have the honour to present this bill to your Excellency,
            humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent."</p>
         <p>His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal assent.</p>
         <p>His Excellency then addressed both Houses, and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the 16th of September.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25</p>
         <p>"Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New York a few days ago. On his way he passed three days at Plattsburgh, the head-quarters of the American army, which, from ocular observation, he
            states to consist of 8 or 10,000 men, under the command of General Bloomfield, Mooar, and Petit. This force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars, about the same number of militia, and some
            volunteers from the southward. The militia is almost all from the state of New York, for the Yankees still refuse to march. with this force no doubt is entertained here but they will make
            an attack ; and if they mean to make it this season, they must be prompt in their movements, for the weather is getting cold, and they are not well clothed or appointed. Mr –, indeed,
            states half of them to be without shoes or stockings, which will never do for a winter campaign in this country. To repel the threatened attack, we are making every preparation in our
            power, and the Canadians seem well disposed to second the Government. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon, the left of which is at Chambly, and extending to Chateaguny ; the main
            encampment is half way between St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-auNoix is strongly fortified, with a boom and a chain secured across
            the river. This line of defence is composed of four regiments of the line, and 2000 drafted militia, with a corps of about 400 Canadian voltigeurs, raised last spring. The Royals, a very
            strong battalion, lately arrived from the West Indies, are now marching to join the camp. The citizens, both here and at Quebec, mount guard, and do garrison : indeed there are in this
            island (Montreal) five battalions of militia, say 3 to 4000 men, pretty well disciplined, and who on an alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– A new regiment of embodied militia
            has lately been formed by drafts from the different regiments of inrolled militia in this island, and old Major Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gentlemen of the North-west
            Company army are forming a corps of their voyageurs, who will be most useful troops to act in advance with the Indians. The number originally proposed was 200, but the men have come
            forward so handsomely, that they are to consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of this corps, Mr Shaw, Major, and the other partners of the Company are Captains
            and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded by those whom they have accustomed to obey, may be considered as already disciplined, at least in point of subordination.</p>
         <p>"Sir George confines his operations to mere defence. La Motte, with about 70 Indians, advanced through the woods, about ten days ago, within hearing of this redoubtable army, and set up a
            war whoop, which so completely terrified them that though they could see no enemy, they lay on their arms for two two successive nights, in no expectation of an attack–to prevent which,
            they cut down their best bridge, and destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean to invade us. Mr –, who was several days at their headquarters, and who was offered the rank of
            Lieutenant-Colonel in the army, has, it is said, proposed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 men ; and Sir George is said to have replied, that his plan was fixed, not to make
            any attack nor to send a man across the line.</p>
         <p>"This forebearance, which the Yankees impute to fear or weakness, tends only to increase their insolent swaggering, and their enmity is to inveterate to be allayed by any thing but hard
            knocks."</p>

         <p>The Rota frigate arrived on Monday off Plymouth, with a fleet from Halifax under convoy, and passed up the channel with the chief part of the trade. From the Hydra transport, which put
            into Plymouth, we have received the following official notification of Sir James Yeo's success on Lake Ontario, the American notices of which have already been published.</p>
         <p>Bulletin.</p>
         <p>"Head-quarters Kingston, Aug. 14. 1813 "By accounts received from his Excellency the Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces, from Commodore Sir James Yeo, dated off York, half-past
            one P.M. on the 11th instant, the following particulars have been transmitted of the capture and loss of the enemy's armed schooners:–</p>
         <p>"On Thursday evening last, the 10th instant, the enemy's squadron, under the Command of Commodore Chauncey, got under weigh from their anchorage, off the mouth of Niagara River, and, with
            a fine breeze from the east, stood towards our fleet, which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land, gave us the wind of the enemy, when
            our squadron stood for them, on which immediately bore away from us under as much sail as their schooners could carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's fleet formed a long.
            The Pike, Madison, Oneida, and six schooners (two schooners were placed to windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our squadron as it should come up). At eleven the squadron got
            within gun-shot of the schooners, when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their going so fast, it was more than an hour before the Wolf, our headmost ship, could pass them ; at this time
            the rest of the squadron was two and three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming up with the Madison and Pike, they put before the wind and made sail, firing their stern-chasers.–
            Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squadron up with the enemy, as the Wolf was the only ship which could keep up with them, then made sail between them and the two schooners to
            windward, which he captured, and which are called the Julia and Growler, each carrying one long 32pounder and long 12-pounder, and 40 men.– Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the
            Scourge, of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the night of the 9th, in carrying sail, and all on board perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and capture, the enemy's squadron
            are reduced to 10 vessels, and our's increased to eight. It is ascertained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders, and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders, and 340 men. Boat loads
            of troops were taken on board the enemy's squadron on Monday last, for the purpose, it is supposed, of repelling the boarders.– The Wolf has not received any material injury, and not a
            person hurt. The prisoners were landed on the 11th instant, and the Growler's damage repaired. She had lost her bowsprit, and was otherwise cut up.</p>
         <p>"Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthusiasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a close engagement."</p>

         <p>(From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters, Kingston, July 13.</p>
         <p>By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg, dated the 9th instant, the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American
            post at Fort Schlosser.</p>
         <p>In the night of the 4th instant, a party, consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment, under Ensign Winder, and thirty-four of the militia, the whole under the
            command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke, of the Lincoln militia, crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser, which they reached a little before day-break, and completely surprised
            the guard, consisting of two Lieutenants, one serjeant, and eight privates, whom they made prisoners, together with three civilians and three of our own subjects, found in the Fort.– The
            party remained in the Fort about one hour, loading their boats form the public stores and wharf, and brought with them one brass six-pounder, 57 stand of arms, two and a half kegs of
            musket ball cartridges, 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats, one gun-boat, two batteaux, 20 barrels of salt, 17 casks tobacco, eight barrels of pork, and one barrel of whiskey,
            with a number of spades, oars, and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore, and several shots were fired, but the boats returned to
            Chippawa with their prisoners, and the articles they had captured, without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the
            Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant, a party of the King's regiment, and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines
            and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy, in which the latter
            lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three
            Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons, for reconnoitering the spot where the
            medicines were deposited, and conducting the party to it.</p>
         <p>A few nights ago, the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats, and more than 100 barrels of pork, flour, and other articles brought away from thence, together with a very fine
            Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour, being destroyed.</p>
         <p>Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters, Kingston, July 15 1813.</p>
         <p>G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg, reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at
            daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments, together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th, and about 40 militia, the whole amounting
            to 240 men, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats, loaded with stores
            and provisions, and three field pieces, a twelve and two six-pounders, were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt.</p>
         <p>Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed, a strong reinforcement of the enemy, aided by Indians, pressed this small detachment, by which Captain Saunders, of the 41st,
            and 15 men, were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp, Lieutenant Montpesson, of the 41st, and 15 rank and file, wound ed. The wounded were brought over.</p>
         <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds, severe, but not considered dangerous.</p>
         <p>By his Excellency's command,</p>
         <p>Edward Baynes, Adjutant-General</p>
         <p>British Expedition to Plattsburgh</p>
         <p>The following is an extract of a letter from a respectable citizen at Burlington, dated Aug. 1. 1813</p>
         <p>"An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July, with intelligence that the British had left the Isle au Noix, with a force consisting of the two armed sloops, of 11 guns each, and four
            gallies, of one gun each, and 100 batteaux full of men, and had progressed within one mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed, and the troops under arms, but no enemy appeared.
            Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops, under the command of Colonel Murray, had landed, and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition, there being no force to oppose them
            except the militia of the town and vicinity, who being only 400 in number, retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State, Pike's encampment, barracks at Serenac
            cantonment, and every building belonging to the United States, were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50,000 dollars. The enemy
            left Plattsburgh on the 1st, and are understood to be proceeding this way ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? On General Dearborn invading Canada, and taking possession of Fort George, he
            sent off to Greenbush, as prisoners of war, the following respectable inhabitants : Messrs Edwards, Murehead, Dickson Lyminston, Lawe, two Kerrs, M'Ewan, Parson Addison, Howell, Heron,
            Green, Baldwin, Clinch Jones, Ball, Decoe, and John Crook. Messrs Lawe, M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have
            joined the Americans.</p>
         <p>General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June, on account of indisposition. General Lewis says, in his dispatch to Secretary at War, that he did not think the
            General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence, he uniformly
            relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour, is succeeded at Fort George, Niagara, and on the Canadian frontier, by
            General Boyd.</p>
         <p>The Indian chief, Tecumseh, has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia, for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all
            the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay, who commanded there, had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his
            relief.</p>
         <p>Sir James Yeo, after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George, swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus, and took the whole of the
            provisions, consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour, and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River, he
            inflicted the same loss on the enemy, taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on
            board the fleet, to serve as mariners</p>
         <p>There were at Quebec, on the 22d July, 1000 American prisoners of war, captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In
            consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers, the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole. The Melpomene frigate, with De Meuron's regiment,
            from the Mediterranean, arrived in the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July.</p>
         <p>James Gready, private in the 8th, or King's regiment, and Terence Hunt, private in the 6th foot, were in the latter end of June, tried by Court Martials, for deserting to the enemy, and
            being found in arms, and were publicy shot at Kingston, Canada, pursuant to their sentence.</p>
         <p>It appears from the Quebec papers, and from the general orders issued by the Commander in Chief in Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkinson on the banks of the Miami river, the
            American military chest, containing 15,000l. Sterling was among the property captured by the British.</p>
         <p>Captain Waugh, of the 103d regiment, died at Chamely on the 2d July.</p>
         <p>General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark, the late commandant at Burlington, for a defalcation of about 50,000 dollars.</p>

         <p>By the Dunlop, Captain Abrams, arrived on Sunday last, at Greenock, from Quebec, after a passage of 36 days, papers and letters have been received from Canada, to the 19th, which contain
            an amount of an engagement between a detachment of the British force under Lieut.-Col. Morrison, consisting of the 49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies of the Canadian militia,
            and a body of American troops, amounting to 4000 men, which ended in the defeat of the latter, with great loss. This action was produced by the attempt of the American General to advance
            to Montreal, from which it appears, however, he has now begun to measure back his steps, having crossed to the American side of the river where the action was fought, and being actively
            pursued in his retreat by the British troops.</p>
         <p>The following information has been received by the Alexander, Captain Henry, which arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday:–</p>
         <p>"Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 "The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men, under the command of General Wilkinson. The division commanded by General Boyd, consisting of about 3000 to 4000
            infantry, cavalry &amp;c. was alone engaged upon the 11th instant.</p>
         <p>"The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen. Conington and Colonel Preston, killed–probably 600 men killed, wounded, and taken.</p>
         <p>"The consequence was a precipitate retreat across the St Lawrence at Cornwall on the 13th, and evacuating the province. General Wilkinson marched his troops into the Straits, the route of
            Plattsburgh, leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon river, where they were frozen in on the 16th, and 2000 men to protect them."</p>
         <p>Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, with dispatches.</p>

      <titular>Destruction of a Moravian Settlement in Canada </titular>
      <texto>
         <p>The following letter received in town, gives a description of the wanton and barbarous conduct of the American army, in destroying a settlement of the Moravian missionaries, in their late
            irruption into province:–</p>
         <p>"Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North America, by a letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, concerning a report of the total destruction of our settlement, ??? ???
            on the 6th of October, by the American army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the invasion of that province, after the capture of the little fleet on Lake Erie, and the
            defeat of the s[?]al British force under the [?] of occupying the Chapel and some other houses for our sick British soldiers, and considering the danger the Christian Indians were in from
            the malice of the Americans, it was his advice, that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation should retreat farther into the country. When the Americans were successful in the latter,
            it became necessary to take steps of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to the brethren, and offered to purchase the houses and cottages, but their defeat prevented it. On entering
            the place, the Americans first pretended to be friendly, and sorry that the Indians had fled, who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Missionaries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall,
            and the aged Missionary, Michael Young, remained.</p>
         <p>"During the first night the Americans already changed their tone, or rather showed their real character. They began to abuse the Missionaries with curses, and all manner of insults,
            plundering the houses ; and General Harrison, to whom we appealed, would grant no redress. They took every thing that was??? away ; and, under a pretence that King's stores and English
            goods were lodged in the houses, ransacked every place, and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Commodore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the lake, was there, and
            behaved rather better than the rest, advicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could. They did so with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans set the place on fire, and
            burnt down the whole, even every outhouse[?]. The poor Missionaries had a very tedious journey, and reached Silitiz, a settlement of the Brethren in Pennsylvania, December 11. Whither the
            Christian Indians have fled is not known ; they had proposed to go to the Grand River, about 100 miles off.</p>

         <p>A proclamation, issued by Governor Macquarrie, appears in the Sidney Gazette of 14th May, stating that Peter Mills Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Port Dalrymple, Van Dieman's Land, and
            George Williams, Acting Deputy Commissary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement, had absconded from their habitations, and fled to the woods ; that their object was to live by
            rapine and violence ; to effect which they had armed themselves, and taken the command of a gang of 26 desperadoes, with whose aid they had committed numerous robberies–entering the lands
            of settlers, driving away their cattle, and plundering their houses. The proclamation declares that those who shall return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next, shall
            be pardoned and saved harmless from all offences, except the crime of wilful murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer, as outlaws.</p>
         <p>Sydney, New South Wales, Jan. 4. The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea, viz, 167 chests of souchong, 200 ditto bobea, 200 hyson skin, and young hyson 50 ; in all 617
            chests. The consequences has been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of Mauritius, the Hope American
            ship, laden with tea and sundies, valued at L80,000, was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy, Captain Allen.</p>
         <p>In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and British ships, and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand, of Otaheite, and of the other islands in
            the South Pacific Ocean, which have led to the destruction of several vessels, with their crews, by the natives, and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those islands, both by British
            shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New South Wales, without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval
            officer for the time being at the port, for L.1000 sterling, binding him and his crew not to commit any act of hostility, or to be guilty of any trespass, or forment any animosities
            between the natives, or take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum specified in
            the bond.</p>
         <p>A small party, who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage in a direction towards Broken Bay, for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country, have discovered
            an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which one gentlemen, Mr Robert Campbell, has already sent thither an extensive herd of cattle, and this example is likely to be
            followed by others.</p>
         <p>Thomas West, who came to this colony a convict for life, in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?], in 1801, has received from his Excellency a conditional pardon, in consideration of his general
            good conduct and character for sobriety and industry, and also in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen, within two miles of
            Sydney, being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty of this town.</p>
         <p>Sydney, New South Wales, May 21. The good understanding between the natives and our settlers, which had been maintained for the last six years, has given place to frequent outrages
            attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday, a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler, when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a
            boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again, and killed on private, Isaac Eustace, and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and
            Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them, shot a woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker, a stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur, killed the man and two
            women, named Sullivan and Herburg.</p>
         <p>Sydney, New South Wales, Feb. 12. On Monday last arrived the ship General Hewett, Captain Earle, from England, having a detachment of the 46th regiment, commanded by Major Oglivie ; and
            yesterday arrived the Windham, Captain Bligh, also from England, having on board the head-quarters of the 46th regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle, who succeeded
            Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell, as Lieutenant-Governor of the territory, and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; also Lieutenant Walters, of the navy, agent for transports– Of the 300
            convicts which the General Hewett received on board, 35 died on the passage.</p>

         <p>[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.]</p>
         <p>Quebec, July 15. The commercial world is flourishing here, but in political matters, I am sorry to say, we are sadly in the back ground. The old defensive system is still adhered to, and,
            I fear much, with all our reinforcements, we shall do little good till we have another commander in chief. There is now a great body of regular troops in this country, and a handful of
            brave fellows have recently been almost sacrificed par la petite guerre at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower province, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing nothing.</p>
         <p>Some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from France do not conceal their sentiments– On inspecting one of the regiments the other day, our chief took occasion, as usual, to
            make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly, that such systems were now completely exploded–that he had had the
            honour of serving very lately under a much more celebrated</p>
         <p>General that it was probable he would ever serve under again–that his men had been accustomed to fight, not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was called on to follow, he should
            certainly retire from the service. Such language you may suppose was not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy to find that we now have military men amongst us, who are not afraid
            to speak out ; as it appears the numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to.</p>
         <p>Montreal, July 14. I consider this country now as perfectly secure against any attempts that the Americans may make, not withstanding the system of our chief does not seem to be changed.
            He has received a great many more troops this year than he had any idea of, and does not seem pleased at having so large a force unhis command, as the country will now look to him for some
            offensive operation against the enemy. He has done nothing the whole summer but parade about 6000 men at Chambly, where he makes them march past him twice a-week, bowing and scraping,
            instead of employing them where they ought to be.</p>
         <p>You will have heard of an American army of about 6000, under General Jacob Brown, having crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, with a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed
            them but was overpowered by numbers, and sustained considerable loss. I inclose a general order published yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby you will find that our loss has
            been great.</p>
         <p>Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly any force, and it appears very singular indeed, that so great a body of men, as are now on the other side of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux
            Noix, at least 10,000 men, should be left for the purpose of parade, when they are so much wanted in the upper province.</p>
         <p>I sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business, as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to make an attack upon us with
            impunity.</p>

         <p>Quebec, Sept. 10. The Americans, to the number of 900 men, landed and attacked Fort Michillimackinac, in Lake Huron, on the 4th August. They were repulsed by the British garrison.</p>
         <p>The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken by the British. This place was considered as of great importance to the enemy.</p>
         <p>Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfortune to break his leg, by a fall from his horse. This officer had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier, when he met
            with this accident.</p>
         <p>On the 31st August, the British troops broke their encampment at Odell Town, near Lake Champlain, and proceeded immediately to take possession of the position which the American army had
            just abandoned at the village of Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard, and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh, and partly to Sackett's Harbour, on Lake
            Ontario. The British troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Generals Brisbane, Power, and Robinson, and consist of the 13th, 49, 88th, Meuron's regiment, Canadian chasseurs,
            &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
         <p>The 79th[?] or [?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quartered at Cornwall, in Upper Canada.</p>
         <p>The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st, or Royal Scots, are stationed at Quebec.</p>
         <p>The 3rd[?], 104th flank[?] companies, 103d, 8th, or King's, 100th, regiment de Watteville, [?] battalion of 1st, or Royal Scots, and 41st flank[?] companies are with the army under
            Lieutenant General Drummon, on the Niagara frontier, Upper Canada.</p>
         <p>The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal.</p>
         <p>On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieutenant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack was made in three columns, under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment, Lieutenant
            Colonel Drummond 104th regiment, and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get possession of a small hill, named
            Snake-Hill, which the Americans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This latter column failed in their object ; but
            the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort, when their own guns were
            turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place, which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation
            caused by this was so great, and we were obliged to abandon our conquest, and retreat to our original position, with great loss of both officers and men.</p>
         <p>The large ship-building by the British at Kingston, on Lake Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100 guns.</p>
         <p>The battalion of royal marines, commanded by LieutenantColonel Williams, and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix, and parts adjacent, have been broken up and distributed among
            the fleets on the Lakes. The Staff of the battalion proceed immediately to Halifax from Quebec, in the Ceylong armed-en [?] ship.</p>
         <p>The Junon frigate, Captain Upton, has arrived from Halifax at Quebec, with money for Government. The crew of this vessel is to be employed on the Lakes.</p>
         <p>A brig, which sailed from Cork, under convoy of the Antelope, of 50 guns, has arrived at Quebec.–The Antelope, and the ships under convoy, are hourly expected. It is said that there are on
            board the ships of the latter about 4000 troops, chiefly detachments and reinforcements for the regimentsin Canada.</p>
         <p>Captain Dowale, of the royal navy, now commands the fleet on Lake Champlain.</p>

         <p>Canada Papers</p>
         <p>Quebec, Sept. 3. The army from this province has entered the United States by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was at Chazy.</p>
         <p>Quebec, Sept. 8. From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal,
            at Michillimackinac, written since the repulse of the American forces sent there to recapture it. The following are the particulars of that expedition :–</p>
         <p>"On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans landed 900 men, or thereabouts, at the back of the island (Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground cleared, and a
            gentle slope, which enabled their vessels, at anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant fire of grape, &amp;c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed directly over
            the men's heads, as they formed and advanced towards the woods.</p>
         <p>"Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison (150 at most) at the extremity of the woods, and the Indians were stationed on each flank, to keep the enemy from outflanking the
            troops. By a false account of the enemy's intention to land on another part of the island, a certain number of Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians absenting
            themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colonnel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was entertained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison from the forts ;
            it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back between the two forts, and there await the advance of the enemy.</p>
         <p>"A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left flank, and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right flank, fired on the Americans, and threw them into confusion, which
            the Indians soon perceived, and encouraging each other by whoops and yells, totally broke the little order still observed by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all out of reach
            before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of their retreat.</p>
         <p>"Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found on the
            spot!–The Indians lost but one man."</p>
         <p>Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by the enemy were these:</p>
         <p>"On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent against Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Mary's, where they met with no resistance, there being neither troops nor
            Indians, and every person occupied about their usual concerns ; such as bay making, fishing &amp;c. Major Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to indiscriminate plunder, and destroyed
            the whole of the property belonging to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, and vessels, killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees prisoners ; tearing down the
            fences, destroying the gardens, fields, &amp;c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. Let two suffice for the present.</p>
         <p>"Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furniture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized upon by these ruthless plunderers, and carried away. Major Holmes sent to
            the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's son George, and, after threatening and reviling him with the most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head, and said he had a
            great mind to cut his head off, now he was his slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses and stores, Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a certain spot, under pain of
            being shot ; but had he remained, sufforation[?] must have been his fate, being so near the buildings in flames : he therefore risked being shot, and came off, and thereby effected a
            timely escape.</p>
         <p>"Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exercised on a poor horse, which they made us of all day in carting their plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to the cart,
            tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in flames, and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt, and his bones seen
            there by the writer of this."</p>

         <p>Canada Papers</p>
         <p>Montreal, Oct. 29 The express from Upper Canada, which arrived yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the preceding day, that the enemy had precipitately retreated
            on the 19th instant, from before Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of provisions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their
            force, and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie.</p>
         <p>Further accounts from Kingston have been received this morning to the 26th instant, when the official report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie, after the destruction of the works, had
            not reached that place, but there was no doubt of the fact.</p>
         <p>Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four hours from Fort George, further confirms
            the previous intelligence, and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken, before the Americans effected their escape across the river.</p>
         <p>On the 18th the British came up with his rear guard, and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening on our side. This was at Chippawa
            Creek.– The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of his fortifications.</p>
         <p>A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning, brings no additional news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the sick of the army of Niagara on board. We
            again sailed for the head of the Lake.</p>
         <p>A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, says that a severe action took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and wounded. That of the enemy is
            supposed to be very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution. Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30.</p>
         <p>Montreal, Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that
            quarter mention that General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie.</p>
         <p>Quebec, Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one o'clock.</p>
         <p>The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The enemy did cross over to our side till the moment
            his fleet was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure.</p>
         <p>(From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the papers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some
            satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British Government is pledged to do something for British interests in North American, and regret
            that that something is so little.</p>
         <p>The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly just, and would, under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces. The Lakes are to be
            exclusively British. On these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so, how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of
            another war, if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for military purposes, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the river St Lawrence,
            from Montreal to Kingston, and from Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from
            interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side, the consequent badness of the roads, and difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th
            southern bank of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power of supplying themselves, and operating on that frontier, by the roads now existing, and from Lake Champlain,
            has been worth a large force to them, during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St Francis and Kingston, and keep
            a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of Montreal.</p>
         <p>The position of Canada, relative to the United States, with its present boundaries, is an extraordinary one ; so much so, that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of
            defence much beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations, the superiority which we then had on the Lakes, the good disposition of the inhabitants, and the prudent
            conduct of the commander of the forces, alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of five</p>
         <p>hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie, is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact, or who are habituated to reflection ; and
            whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by
            the Lakes, upon which an army can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long way in his rear, protected by his army, a country covered with woods, and a militia more effective than
            the best troops in such a country, always ready for the protection of their property and their houses– Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be
            counted by its numbers.</p>
         <p>We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part of the State of New York extending to the St Lawrence, between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, shall be fully settled, the whole of Upper
            Canada must fall to the United States, the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the Americans confirmed in the
            possession of Sackett's Harbour, Presqu-ile, Detroit and Michilimackinac, than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the means of
            establishing a superiority on the Lakes, whenever she chuses to exert them, but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of that frontier, when once fully settled, supported as
            they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New York and adjoining States.</p>
         <p>From the United States Papers Urbanna, Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit, to General M'Arthur, in six days, in which Governor Cass says–" A state of things has arrived, in
            which your presence, with the force at your disposal, is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us ; they are
            murdering the people, and breaking up the settlements. There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place, most probably within a mile of it, with the avowed
            purpose of attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the country, and none of description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– My opinion is, that you should hasten
            on with the mounted men with all possible expedition."</p>
         <p>The express came by water, the land communiation being entirely cut off.</p>
         <p>Albany, Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday, after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are:</p>
         <p>An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State. An act to encourage privateering. An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. An act to provide
            for the repayment of certain sums of money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New York, for the defence of the State, and for other purposes. An act to prevent the apprehension of
            British deserters. An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of colour. An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volunteers, and for paying the militia called into
            service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the army and navy of the United States.</p>
         <p>The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12,000 men, for the term of two years, provided the Government of the United States shall have declared their intention to
            pay, clothe and subsist them at their expence.</p>
         <p>The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers.</p>
         <p>The following resolution, introduced by Mr Monell, passed both Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:–</p>
         <p>Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New York view, with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation, the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the
            British Commissioners at Ghent–that, however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country, they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour
            and dignity–that they therefore strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war, as the best means of the
            bringing the contest to an honourable termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights, liberty, and independence.</p>
         <p>The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey :</p>
         <p>Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. "Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 10th October, where his presence has been of the utmost importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the
            8th, and retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival, sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of the
            90th, and a supply of provisions and stores for the right division, and arrived off Fort George on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforcement, Sir James returned to Kingston
            on the 24th.</p>
         <p>"The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army, making a force of 7 or 8000 men, advanced upon General Drummond, and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the
            15th instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them, and making no impression, retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from whence they advanced one of Izard's
            brigades, 1500 men, on the 19th, with a view of our turning our right, and attempted to cross the Chippawa, about six miles from its mouth, where they were met with by a corps of about
            1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in which the Glengarries supported their high character, and, in the evening, Jonathan
            finding himself foiled, and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads, retired again to the main body at Black Creek.</p>
         <p>"Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy were said to have been considerable, though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two
            field-pieces there, and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood, a well-directed discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this time our fleet being announced,
            gave alarm to the enemy, and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie.</p>
         <p>"They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance, under Major-General Watteville, close to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the high ground, which General Drummond had not
            left many weeks before, and could push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which it will require a few columns of
            fresh troops to dislodge him, but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion, I trust I shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of
            the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said, that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of General Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo, and that they had passed over some heavy
            artillery and stores, leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it.</p>
         <p>"Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment, and the</p>
         <p>remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of artillery, a 9pounder, and detachments
            from the 6th and 82d regiments, and a large supply of provisions and stores. The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th,
            850 strong, were to have been embarked in the fleet, but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st, 89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by this trip of the fleet,
            which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston,
            where she has been laid down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more
            ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state, that the capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important benefits in the
            security of that post, and the territory dependent upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, arrived there on the 14th October,
            without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with his brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies, and
            would attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain.</p>
         <p>"The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's army being completed, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being deemed impracticable this season, Sir George
            returned last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown, with a considerable part of his force, to move to Sackett's Harbour,
            and has thus left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him.</p>
         <p>"I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of
            his Excellency, by the addresses which are now preparing, and which I can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt is going to
            England, as he will afford true information upon the state of the country, and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events."</p>

         <p>New South Wales</p>
         <p>A journey into the interior of New South Wales, across the Blue Mountains, performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac quarrie, Governor of the settlement. From the official account, dated
            Sydney, June 10. 1815.</p>
         <p>The Governor desires to communicate, for the information of the public, the result of his late tour over the Western or Blue Mountains, undertaken for the purpose of being enabled
            personally to appreciate the importance of the track of country lying westward of them, which had been explored in the latter end of the year 1813, and beginning of 1814, by Mr George
            William Evans, Deputy Surveyor of Lands.</p>
         <p>To those who know how very limited a track of country has been hitherto occupied by the colonists of New South Walves, extending along the eastern coast to the north and south of Port
            Jackson only 80 miles, and westward about 40 miles, to the foot of that chain of mountains in the interior which forms its western boundary, it must be a subject of astonishment and
            regret, that amongst so large a population no one appeared, within the first twenty-five years of the establishment of this settlement, possessed of sufficient energy of mind to induce him
            fully to explore a passage over these mountains ; but when it is considered that for the greater part of that time even this circumscribed portion of country afforded sufficient produce
            for the wants of the people, whilst on the other hand, the whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a thick, and in many places, nearly an impenetrable forest, the surprise at
            the want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate very considerably.</p>
         <p>The records of the colony only afford two instances of any bold attempt having been made to discover the country to the westward of the Blue Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass, and the
            other by Mr Caley, and both ended in disappointment; a cirumstance which will not be much wondered at by those who have lately crossed these mountains.</p>
         <p>To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson, of the Royal veteran company, the merit is due of having, with extraordinary patience and much fatigu, effected the
            first passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mountains.</p>
         <p>The Governor being strongly impressed with the importance of the object, had, early after his arrival in this colony, formed the resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to
            the western country, and willingly availed himself of the facilities which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly, on the 20th of November 1813, he entrusted
            the accomplishment of this object to Mr George William Evans, deputy surveyor of lands, the result of whose journey was laid before the public, through the medium of the Sydney Gazette, on
            the 12th of February, 1814.</p>
         <p>The favourable account given by Mr Evans of the country he had explored, induced the Governor to cause a road to be constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and provisions to
            the interior ; and men of good character, from amongst a number of convicts who had volunteered their services, were selected to perform this arduous work, on condition of being fed and
            clothed during the continuance of their labour, and being granted emancipations as their final reward on the completion of the work.</p>
         <p>The direction and superintendence of this great work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be
            encountered, and sees what has been done, he effected its completion in six months from the time of its commencement, happily without the loss of a man, or any serious accident. The
            Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony, in the execution of this arduous work, which promises to be of the greatest public utility, by
            opening a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising. When it is considered that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the comforts of his own house, and the society of his
            numerous family, and exposed himself to much personal fatigue, with only such temporary covering as the bark hut could afford from the inclemency of the season, it is difficult to express
            the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and services are entitled.</p>
         <p>Mr Cox having reported the road as completed on the 21st of January, the Governor, accompanied by Mrs Macquarrie, and that gentleman, commenced his tour on the 25th of April last, over the
            Blue Mountains, and was joined by Sir John Jamieson, at the Nepean, who accompanied him during the entire tour. The following gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: Mr Campbell,
            Secretary ; Captain Antill, Major of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts, Aide decamp ; Mr Redfern, Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr Oxley, Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan, Deputy Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin,
            Painter and Naturalist ; and Mr G. Evans, Deputy Surveyor of lands, who had been sent forward for the purpose of making further discoveries, and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at
            Bathurst Plains.</p>
         <p>The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the first depot, and thence to a resting place, now called Spring Wood, distant twelve miles from Emu Ford, was through a very handsome
            open forests of lofty trees, and much more practicable and easy than was expected. The facility of the ascent for this distance excited surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to
            give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to encounter. At a further disstance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the
            quality of the soil, the former becoming stunted, and the latter barren and rocky. At this place, the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. Here the country became altogether
            mountainous, and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th mile (it is to be observed that the measure commences at Emu Ford), a pile of stones attracted attention. It is close to the line of
            road, on the top of a rugged and abrupt ascent, and is supposed to have been placed there by Mr Caley, as the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Governor gave that part of the mountain
            the name as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a succession of steep and rugged
            hills, some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage altogether ; but at this place a considerable extensive plain is arrived at, which constitutes the summit of the western
            mountains ; and from thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town of Windsor, the river Hawkesbury, Prospect Hill, and other objects
            within that part of the colony now inhabited, of equal interest, are distinctly seen from hence. The majestic grandeur of the situation, combined with the various objects to be seen from
            this place, induced the Governor to give it the appellation of the King's Table Land. On the south-west side of the King's Table Land the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of
            immense depth, at the bottom of which is seen a glen, as romantically beautiful as can be imagined, bounded on the further side by mountains of great magnitude, terminating equally
            abruptly as the others, and the whole thickly covered with wood. The length of this picturesque and remarkable track of country is about 24 miles, to which the Governor gave the name of
            the Prince Regent's Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third mile, on the top of a hill, an opening presents itself on the south-west side of the Prince Regent's Glen, from whence a view
            is obtained particularly beautiful and grand–mountains rising beyond mountains, with stupendous masses of rock in the fore ground, here strike the eye with admiration and astonishment. The
            circular form in which the whole is so wonderfully disposed induced the Governor to give the name of Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch
            from the Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of the mountain which forms one side of the Prince Regent's Glen, and there it suddenly
            terminates in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet high, as ascertained by measurement. The road constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and tremendous descent, through all its
            windings, is no less than three-fourths of a mile in length, and has been executed with such skill and stability as reflects much credit on him. The labour here undergone, and the
            difficulties surmounted, can only be appreciated by those who view this scene. In order to perpetuate the memory of Mr Cox's services, the Governor deemed it a tribute justly due to him to
            give his name to this grand and extraordinary pass, and he accordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descended into a valley at the bottom of this pass, the retrospective view of the
            overhanging mountain is magnificently grand. Although the present pass is the only practicable point yet discovered for descending by, yet the mountain is much higher than those on either
            side of it, from whence it is distinguished at a considerable distance, when approaching it from the interior, and in this point of view it has the appearance of a very high distinct hill,
            although it is in fact only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The Governor gave the name of Mount York to this termination of the ridge, in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke of
            York.</p>
         <p>On descending Cox' Pass, the Governor was much gratified by the appearance of good pasture land and soil fit for cultivation, which was the first he had met with since the commencement of
            his tour. The valley at the base of Mount York he called the Vale of Clwyd, in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale of that name in North Wales. The grass in this vale
            is of a good quality, and very [?]dant, and a rivulet of fine water runs along it from the eastward, which unites itself at the western extremity of the vale with another rivulet
            containing still more water. The junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river, now called by the Governor, Cox's River, which takes its course, as has been since ascertained
            through the Prince Regent's Glen, and empties itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjectured, from the nature of the country through which it passes, that it mut be one of the
            principal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkesbury, into which the Nepean discharges itself. The Vale of Clwyd, from the base of
            Mount York, extends six miles in a westerly direction, and has its termination at Cox's River. Westward of this river the country again becomes hilly, but it is generally open forest land,
            and very good passage.</p>
         <p>Three miles to the westward of the Vale of Clwyd, Messrs Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson, had formerly terminated their excursion ; and when the various difficulties are considered which
            they had to contend with, especially until they had effected the descent from Mount York, to which place they were obliged to pass through a thick brush-wood, where they were under the
            necessity of cutting a passage for their baggage horses, the severity of which labour had seriously affected their healths, their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite
            much surprise and admiration. In commemoration of their merits, three beautiful high hills, joining each other at the end of their tour at this place, have receieved their names in the
            following order, viz. Mount Blaxland, Wentworth's Sugar Loaf, and Lawson's Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and narrow vallies alternately form the track of country from Cox's
            River, for a distance of 16 miles, until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the stage between these rivers is consequently very severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this range the
            Governor gave the name of Clarence Hilly Range.</p>
         <p>Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short distance from it, a very singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attentions, its summit being crowned with a large and very
            extraordinary looking rock, nearly circular in form, which gives the whole very much the appearance of a hill fort, such as are frequent in India. To this lofty hill Mr Evans, who was the
            first European discoverer, gave the name of Mount Evans. Passing on from hence the country continues hilly, but affords good pasturage, gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley, which is
            distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight miles. The land here is level, and the first met with unencumbered with timber. It is not of very considerable extent, but abounds with a
            great variety of herbs and plants, such as would probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanist. The beautiful little valley runs northwest and south-east, between hills of
            easy ascent, thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth Valley, the country becomes again hilly, and in other respects resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for
            some miles. Having reached Campbell River, distant 13 miles from Sidmouth Valley, the Governor was highly gratified by the appearance of the country, which there began to exhibity an open
            and extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains. Judging from the height of the banks, and its general width, the Campbell River must be on some occasions of very
            considerable magnitude ; but the extraordinary drought which has apparently prevailed on the western side of the mountains, equally as throughout this colony for the last three years, has
            reduced this river so much, that it may be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream at the present time. In the reaches or pools of the Campbell River, the very curious
            animal called the Paradox, or Water Mole, is seen in great numbers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly rich, and the grass is consequently luxuriant. Two miles to the southward of the
            line of road which crosses the Campbell River, there is a very fine rich track of low lands, which has been named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here growing in considerable quanities.
            The Fish River, which forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to the northward of the road and bridge over the latter, has also two very fertile plains on its banks, the one
            called O'Connel Plains, and the other Macquarrie Plains, both of considerable extent, and very capable of yielding all the necessities of life.</p>
         <p>At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell River, Bathurst Plains open to the view, presenting a rich track of champaign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on
            both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills, thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River, which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River, takes a winding course
            through the Plains, which can be easily traced from the high lands ajoining, by the particular verdure of the trees on its banks, which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of
            the plains. The level and clean surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation.</p>
         <p>It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise, whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed
            by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of man created a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described.</p>
         <p>The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains on Thursday the 4th of May, and encamped on the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie River–the situation being selected in consequence of
            its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles in every direction around it. At this place the Governor remained for a week, which time he occupied in making excursions
            in different directions through the adjoining country, on both sides the river.</p>
         <p>On Sunday, the 7th of May, the Governor fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town at some future period, to which he gave the name of Bathurst, in honour of the present Secretary
            of State for the Colonies. The situation of Bathurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may occur, and is at the same time so near to the river on its south bank
            as to derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of whatever description who may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to
            themselves at this place will have the highly important advantages of a rich and fertile soil, with a beautiful river flowing through it, for all the uses of man. The Governor mut however
            add, that the hopes which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming navigable to the Western Sea have ended in disappointment.</p>
         <p>During the week that the Governor remained at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a south-west direction, and on that occasion, as
            well as on all the others, he found the country chiefly composed of vallies and plains, separated occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil throughout being generally fertile, and well
            circumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or grazing.</p>
         <p>The Governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to communicate to the public that the favourable reports which he had received of the country to the west of the Blue Mountains have
            not been by any means exaggerated. The difficulties which present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great and inevitable, but thsoe persons who may be inclined to become
            permanent settlers there will probably content themselves withvisiting this part of the colony but rarely, and of course will have them seldom to encounter. Plenty of water, and a
            sufficiency of grass are to be found in the mountains for the support of such cattle as may be sent over them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pasturage which the new country
            affords are fully extensive enough for any increase of population and stock which can possibly take place for many years.</p>
         <p>Within a distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst there is not less than 50,000 acres of land clear of timber, and fully one half of that may be considered excellent soil, well
            calculated for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in proportion as the soil improves the timber degenerates ; and it is to be remarked, that everywhere to the westward of the
            mountains it is much inferior both in size and quality to that within the present colony ; there is, however, a sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within the district around
            Bathurst for the purposes of house-building and husbandry.</p>
         <p>The Governor has here to lament that neither coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in the western country ; articles in themselves of so much importance, that the want of them must
            be severely felt whenever that country shall be settled.</p>
         <p>Having enumerated the principal and most important features of this new country, the Governor has now to notice some of its live productions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety of
            game ; and the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of fish, but all of one denomination, resembling the perch in appearance, and of a delicate and fine flavour, not unlike that
            of a rock cod. This fish grows to a large size, and is very voracious. Several of them were caught during the Governor's stay at Bathurst, and at the halting place on the Fish River. One
            of those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught some weighing 25 lb.</p>
         <p>The field game are the kangaroos, emus, black swans, wild geese, wild turkies, bustards, ducks of various kinds, quail, bronze, and other pigeons, &amp;c. &amp;c. The water mole, or
            paradox, also abounds in all the rivers and ponds.</p>
         <p>The site designed for the towns of Bathurst, by observation taken at the Flag Staff, which was erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that name, is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30.
            south, being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House, In Sydney, and 94 1/2 west of it, bearing west 20. 30. north, 83 geographic miles, or 95 1/2 statute miles ; the measured road
            distance from Sydney to Bathurst being 140 English miles.</p>
         <p>The road constructed by Mr Cox, and the party under him, commences at Emu Ford, on the left bank of the river Nepean, and is thence carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst.
            This road has been carefully measured, and each mile regularly marked on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding towards Bathurst.</p>
         <p>The Governor in his tour made the following stages, in which he was principally regulated by the consideration of having good pasturage for the cattle, and plenty of water :–</p>
         <p>1st stage–Spring Wood, distant from Emu Ford 12 miles 2d stage ditto–Jamieson's Valley, or 2d depot, distant from ditto . . . . . . . . . . 28 3d ditto–Blackheath, distant from ditto . . .
            41 4th ditto–Cox's River, distant from ditto . . .56 5th ditto–The Fish River, distant from ditto . 72 6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley, distant from ditto . 80 7th ditto–Campbell River, distant
            from ditto . 91 8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2</p>
         <p>At all of which places the traveller may assure himself of good grass, and water in abundance.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 11th of May, the Governor and suite set out from Bathurst on their return, and arrived at Sidney on Friday the 19th Ult.</p>
         <p>The Governor deems it expedient here to notify to the public, that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the westward of the Blue Mountains, until he shall receive the commands of
            his Majesty's Ministers on that subject, and in reply to the report he is now about to make them upon it.</p>
         <p>In the mean time, such gentlemen or other respectable free persons as may wish to visit this new country will be permitted to do so, on making a written application to the Governor to that
            effect, who will order them to be furnished with written passes. It is at the same time strictly ordered and directed that no person, whether civil or military, shall attempt to travel
            over the Blue Mountains without having previously applied for and obtained permission, in the above prescribed form. The military guard stationed at the first depot on the mountains will
            receive full instructions to prevent the progress of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes. The necessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing this regulation is
            too obvious to every one who will reflect on it to require any explanation here.</p>
         <p>The Governor cannot conclude this account of his tour, without offering his best ackowledgements to William Cox, Esq. for the important services he has rendered to the colony in so short a
            period of time, by opening a passage to the new discovered country, and at the same time assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in recommending his meritorious services on this
            occasion to the favourable consideration of his Majesty's Ministers.</p>

         <p>Canada Papers.</p>
         <p>Montreal, Oct. 5. On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, amounting to upward of 12,000 dollars, arrived at his Majesty's cash-office
            here, under the escort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's.</p>
         <p>At length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very important, as many ex parte details have been published - his taking Fort William by storm,
            making all the partners of the North West Company prisoners, &amp;c. ; but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained. The Canadian Courant puts it in a very clear point of
            view:– Mr Robert Semple, the Governor-General The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River, towards the close of the year 1815, took possession of two establishments belonging to the North
            West Company, which had obtruded themselves on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West traders then altered their route, going into the Upper Country by circuitous ways,
            by which much delay took place ; and in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cartloads of provisions by the former track in June last, with a guard of fifty men ; the advance, twenty-two
            of the number, fell in with one of the natives, whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed within four miles of the settlement ; they were perceived by
            the Governor, and were attacked by a party from the garrison, consisting of about thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place, stated on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 of his men were
            killed ; the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this account that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's conducting the
            expedition we do not justify, nor indeed can we form any opinion on the subject without further authentic details ; it is, however, but justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Company have
            rights, and are a chartered Company ; the North West Traders, though we believe a most respectable body, are only an Association of Merchants.</p>

         <p>Canada Lord Selkirk</p>
         <p>We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city, with the following interesting and authentic communication, on the subject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk, and the Gentlemen of the
            North West Company:</p>
         <p>Extract of a Letter from Montreal, dated 6th October, 1816.</p>
         <p>"In the newspapers which I sent you, you will see some accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's colonists.
            The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River, after having had 22 of their men, including Governor Semple, killed by a party of half-breeds, the spurious offspring of the North West
            Company. As yet have not had an accurate statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party state that these half-breed with some of the North West Company servants, came to
            destroy the settlement, and that Mr Semple, with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, to know what could be their intentions, when those rascals commenced firing on them, and
            massacred all but three, who were fortunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's account is that these half-breeds with some Indians were bringing down provisions from the
            upper part of the Red River to the entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the command of a great part of the river, they were obliged to pass in the rear of the settlement,
            which being observed by Governor Semple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his Fort with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the provisions which were
            intended for the North West Company ; that the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of the Colonists, of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk [?] from Montreal
            for the Red River about the latter end of June, when[?] three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men[?]'s regiment, which had been disbanded, and when he arrived at Fort William on
            Lake Superior, hearing the fate of his Colonists, he[?] immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for high treason, conspiracy and murder, and subsequently warrants against all
            the partners of the N. W. Company, who were at F William, [?] formal possession of their establishment there, and sent Mr M'Gillivray, with about ten others, prisoners to Montreal, with
            all their papers [?] a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs, and several bales[?] of Merchandise, which he found in possession of the North West Company, belonging to the Hudson's Bay
            Company. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days examining the papers, and about four or five days after the arrival of Mr M'Gillivray and the others, they were admitted to bail,
            to appear to take their trial at the next criminal court, or any court of Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de vant Solicitor-General, who was dismissed by Sir James
            Craig, and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's
            counsel and spoke at great length, and what his friends and admirers call very eloquently, strongly opposed their being admitted to bail, but all would not do, and they were accordingly
            bailed ; Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500, sums inconsiderable enough, advering to the high crimes and misdemeanours with which they were charged.</p>
         <p>"In the Montreal Herald you will see a very learned, and (as our neighbour Jonathan would say) a lengthy communication, signed Montius[?], setting forth the rights which the Hudson's Bay
            Company by their charter possess over the Countries which they have granted to Lord Selkirk, and the power vested in him of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and
            regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production, it will no doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet, and when it does, I shall send you one, in case the papers should miscarry. It is
            uncertain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during the winter, or come down to Montreal ; if the latter, he must be down[?] soon[?], as the season for water-travelling will
            shortly close.</p>
         <p>"Montreal is now divided into two parties, one favouring the Lord, and the other the North West Company ; and with the exception of the friends of the latter, strongly in favour of his
            Lordship."</p>

         <p>Emigration to America.</p>
         <p>[ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register, published on Saturday, 12th instant ].</p>
         <p>Cobbett's arrival in America,&amp;c.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday evening, the 27th March, we embarked on board the Importer, D. Ogden, master, bound to New York, where we arrived on the 5th of May, with about 40 steerage passengers,
            farmers, and tradesmen, who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable, and upon one occasion very perilous, from lightning, which
            struck the ship twice, shivered two of the masts, killed a man, struck several people slightly, between two of whom I was sitting, without at all feeling the blow.</p>
         <p>Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and, it is stated in some of the public papers here, that many hundreds have, during the last year, accepted of the offer of
            our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to
            live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short, for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men
            there is every where a plentiful, happy, and easy life. None should come, however, who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor, I see no reason why they should
            expend their last shilling, and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage, in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife
            and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas, at least. A single man 20 guineas, before he gets into work again ; and, as I always said, I never would, if I were in the
            place of such a man, expend my earnings on a sea voyage, and endure all its hardships, in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides, there is the climate, which is
            not so good as ours, though it is not bad, and people often live to an old age. The country is good, but it will easily be conceived, that new face, an entire new scene, a separation from
            every friend, work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived, that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for
            a while. Then, he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first, at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and, they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their
            disgust, merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short, I advice nobody to emigrate, but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with
            a view of settling and farming in the new countries, it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not
            at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such speculations end in disappointment, if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an
            honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets, my advice is, not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration, or to instant disgust. But, to
            stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land, but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us, that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but
            Mr Mellish, in his valuable book, tells us, that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island,
            where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a
            ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English, people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here, with money in his pocket,
            let him resolve to keep it there for a year, and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of
            one, like myself, brought up in the country, always greatly delighted with, and somewhat skilled in, various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting
            their Indian corn. The cherry trees, of which there are multitudes, planted in long avenues or rows, or round the fields, have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit.
            The apple and pear orchards, in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm, are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers,
            who receive, in the country, about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day, with board and lodging, and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts, the
            best of bread, butter, cheese, and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living, I will state a few facts, which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at
            an inn, thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither, and to go by the
            regular stage costs three shillings. Mind, I shall always speak in English money, when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn, have each a bed-room and good bed, have a
            room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish, chops, butter, and eggs, for breakfast, with bread (the very finest I ever sa), crackers,
            sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things, I do not mean that we get them for show, or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg, but a dish full of eggs. Not
            a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut, but in good thumping pieces. For dinner, we have the
            finest of fish, bass, mackerel, lobsters ; of meat, lamb, veal, ham &amp;c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast, with
            preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink, with the kindest and most obliging treatment, on the part of the landlord and landlady, and their sons
            and daughters, we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things
            which no money can purchase any where. The first is, no grumbling on the part of the landlady, except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is, that Mr Wiggins
            has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door, to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts, and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly
            than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here, then are we able to live at an inn, one of the most respectable in the whole country, at the rate of fifty pounds a year,
            while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum.</p>

         <p>Emigration</p>
         <p>The authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is, we are told, guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too
            shocking to admit to belief :</p>
         <p>"Libson, Nov. 4</p>
         <p>"We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from
            Germany and Switzerland to America. We have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores
            of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error, than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations.</p>
         <p>"the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland, occasioned by a superabundance of population, and by the bad harvests of late years, serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men,
            who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention of Governments, and it is with this view
            that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind, fitted out at Amsterdam last August.</p>
         <p>"But we shall first transcribe, from the original, the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the persons of the passengers, as inlcuding
            stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic :–</p>
         <p>"We passengers, promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above stipulated, for so much as we have not yet paid, we engage to gain by
            our labour in America, what we owe, and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound, if required, and if we are unable to find better conditions, to hire ourselves for four or
            five years, in order to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage, equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still
            owe.</p>
         <p>"We promise besides, we passengers, men or women, fathers or mothers, children and families here assembled, the children for their parents, the parents for their children, the brother for
            his brother, and the sister for her sister, when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America, to engage ourselves in service, and to answer for one for the other one for
            all the others, whether he be of our family or not, so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary, until we all and our families have
            employment, and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have children, a family, brothers, and sisters, ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands, our
            children, our brothers, our sisters, being sent separately to whatever place, in order to gain, in private service, profession, or labour, or in any manner that shall be deemed best, the
            price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us, or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain, it is agreed
            for those who have not yet paid for their passage, for those who still owe part, and for those who cannot find an engagement, that they must consent to me, the captain, carrying them to
            such place in America as it shall please me, and wherever I may find it expedient to proceed, or wherever it may suit me to sail."</p>
         <p>"These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship, which was to proceed first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she
            sailed from Amsterdam, and in defiance of the clauses of the contract, by which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage, he had not even embarked the necessary
            quanitity of provisions ; for, after 62 days navigation, the leaks had so gained upon the ship, that she was in danger of sinking, and famine had already made frightful ravages. It was at
            the end of that time, and in this deplo rable condition, that she was forced into Belem, near Lisbon.</p>
         <p>"Long before her arrival on our coasts, the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery, not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions. The water was
            gone, and sea-water was their only drink. So much had they been wasted, that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great many sick, some of who have died since
            their arrival in Portugal.</p>
         <p>"The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council of Health, who, apprehensive of contagion, were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her
            out to sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable, because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea, and all must infallibly have perished. Happily this was deemed
            unnecessary, and a quarantine was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the State. All the Consuls were most
            active and benevolent in affording assistance.</p>
         <p>"Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have, no doubt, answered as little the expectations of those who, seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of
            happiness which they could not find, abandoning their country, their parents, and their friends. In July, a Hamburgh ship, with 106 Swiss passengers, was at Lisbon, in nearly the same
            distress with the Dutch ship. It is said here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. It heaps them pell mell on board ships, and if they
            reach their destination, they are soon convinced of the fallacy of all their hopes.</p>
         <p>"It would be a desirable thing for papers, in countries where these emigrations are excited, to insert the article relative to the charter party, given above, in order that the simple and
            credulous may see what they have to undergo."</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope, dated 15th Nov. 1817: –</p>
         <p>"The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth, White, lying at anchor off Robin Island, with about 120 tons of oil on
            board, was boarded at about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regiment, and convicts, about 12 in number, i. e. five soldiers and seven convicts, who, after
            securing the hatches, &amp;c. obtained possession of the ship, and in the same instant cut the cables, loosed the sails, and favoured by a strong S. E. wind, succeeded in carrying her off,
            at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking, with the exception of the mate, were permitted to leave the ship
            in the boat, which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day.</p>
         <p>"By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden with Government stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last, having struck on
            the reef Roan de Nova, in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved."</p>
         <p>A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th Nonember, says – " Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor - General of Lower Canada, with Captain Campbell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, jun. arrived
            here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is, that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line about
            100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are
            represented as men of great ability, and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side, rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have
            been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance, but expected to be lower, in consequence of the
            Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes."</p>
         <p>Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard –On Friday night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place was thrown into the greatest consternation, by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard, the
            beating of drums, and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works
            situated in the southern part of the dock - yard, near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was
            more distressing to the feelings of the spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, which, from the pressure of the times and want of employment, is crowded with many unfortunate
            individuals. Providence, however, averted the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house. No
            lives, it is understood, have been lost, but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland, and the officers of that ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and
            Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary, with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time, and were
            of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions, as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern, and the
            residence of Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the landlady of the house had but recently lain in, and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham,
            who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, was here yesterday to investiage into the cause, which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage, however, has not been
            so great as was at first expected, and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness, January 11</p>

         <p>Irish Emigrants. New York, Nov. 27.</p>
         <p>Nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an unfriended stranger arrived here, from across the Atlantic, without the means of helping himself, and without
            even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of absolute want. Such, however, is actually the
            situation of hundres who annually land on our shores. To provide for those forlorn beings, several attempts have been made by associations of humane individuals here, but nothing hitherto
            has appeared to promising as that of which an account here follows: –</p>
         <p>At a meeting of Irishmen, and descendents of Irishmen, held at Harmony Hall, on Tuesday the 25th instant, for the purpose of promoting a Settlement of Irish Emigrants; Andrew Morris,
            Chairman, WM. Sampson, Secretary ;</p>
         <p>Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett, the circular previously issues on this subject was read by the Secretary : –</p>
         <p>Circular It is a sentiment long felt, and often expressed, that something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who flock to these shores.</p>
         <p>Without any fixed destination, they remain in the sea port, until beocming victims of bad counsel and bad example, they lose the pure and honest energies with which they left their native
            land, and suffer worse than shipwreck in their moral qualities.</p>
         <p>The Government of this great Republic is well aware of the advantage to be derived from so great a mass of laborious industry, when usefully directed and employed–and of adding to the
            nation's strength, men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so many ties. But it is in the order of things, that some of the friends, particularly the
            countrymen of these emigrants, who have been some time established and known, should come forward to attest the necessity, and guarantee the solidity of the enterprise.</p>
         <p>If his has not been done sooner, it is because every advance in social improvement must come in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion, and the voice of the times that now
            speak.</p>
         <p>It has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement, there are some tracks, particularly in the Illionois territory, where the Irish emigrant, with the instruments
            to which his hands are accustomed, and in a climate congenial to his habits, might procure to himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and, in a few years, be able to repay with gratitude
            the benefits conferred on him.</p>
         <p>We, whose names are undersigned, have met to consult upon the means of promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the distressed, and give to the wanderer a habitation
            and a home. We have thought of no better way than to address, by this circular, the friends and well wishers of Ireland, who co-operation might give most weight to the measure, and to
            submit, whether it might not be advisable to join all our efforts, and petition Congress early in the ensuing session, for a grant of a suitable track, upon a credit of 14 or 15 years,
            subject to such conditions and modifications as the Government may see most fitting.</p>
         <p>to the Government we would offer no deceptive, delusive, or precarious motive, rather chusing to make its wisdom, benignity, and patriotism, the anchor of our hope.</p>
         <p>We request of our, if you approve of our sentiment and of our project, to advance and promote it by your best endeavours ; either by forming organized associations, or by obtaining
            individual signatures, to a petition to the effect stated. We have not yet been able to digest a plan, and have rather chosen to make this humble beginning, in hopes that we should soon
            receive additional light upon the subject from correspondence we solicit. We shall, nevertheless, proceed to investigate the subject, and challenge the co-operation of good and respectable
            men, and request of you to do the same.</p>
         <p>You will please address your answers, and any future correspondence, to Mr James Moffit, No. 15. Frankfort Street New York.</p>
         <p>Thomas Addit Emmet. Denis M'Carthy, William Sampson, John R. Skiddy, James R. Mullaney, John Meyher, William James M'Neven, Cornelius Heeny, Matthew Carroll, Robert Swanton, James Moffit.
            New York, Nov 18, 1817</p>
         <p>Mr Emmet then stated, that he had been requested by the gentlemen who called this meeting, to explain the objects for which it was convenued ; that it could not be necessary to expatiate
            before those he was now addressin, on the situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ireland ; it was at present one of unqualified misetry, partly occasioned by their local oppressions,
            and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; it compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers, and under the pressure of so great poverty, that the most active individual
            benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient present succour, nor procure for them, within a reasonable time, the means of permanent settlement. The consequence was, that
            many of those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county, or forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities, whose original dispositions and qualifications, if
            rightly directed and employed, would have made them valuable and useful members of the community. Besides, the accounts transmitted back to Ireland of their disappointments and destitute
            situations, deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of wretchedness, from endeavouring to better their condition in this more fortunate and favoured land–to the political
            institutions of which they were also more strongly attached.</p>
         <p>A very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to come gentlemen then present the hope that the general Government might be induced, by a strong and united application, to
            grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful, so that an asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers, who would gladly fly from famine and
            persecution to a spot where the sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them a rich harvest, for their own exclusive benefit, and where they might peacefully enjoy all
            the blessings of that republication liberty they loved. The time for making such an application seemed auspicious ; party asperities had softened fown, and probably few would now be led by
            political prejudices to give it opposition. Neither was it unprecedented ; a favour nearly similar had been granted to the French emigrants, and to settlers from Switzerland.</p>
         <p>It is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and we would not succeed by practising any delusion. We could offer nothing but an immediate
            accession of industrious and hardy settlers, who in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically attached to the country and the Government from whence they derived all their
            blessings, and, wherever they were found, would form a barrier against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly be expected from the generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of
            Ireland had everywhere excited in the United States, and from the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might also be addressed to its policy
            and interest. Not only those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here, whose usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction, and who become burdens or scourges to our
            cities, would be rescued and placed in a situation where all the energies of active and enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community ; but also the very fact
            that such an asylum was open and accessible, would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from Ireland, and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. The place upon which
            we have fixed our eyes is in the Illinois territory–it has been lately purchased, and is not yet even surveyed. In the ordinary course of events, it is not likely to be brought into market
            (at least to any extent) for many years ; but if Congress listen to our application, and grant to the settlers an extended credit, Government will receive payment for the land probably as
            soon as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale came round. A large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich during the time that the land would
            otherwise be waste and unproductive, and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the United States would be rapidly and immensely increased, to say nothing of the advantages
            resulting from the strength of such a settled frontier. All these considerations may be strongly urged by men, who can most truly say they are actuated by no views of personal speculation
            or emolument ; who are willing to enter into all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment, without any prospect of gain, or even compensation, except as to what
            may be necessary for defraying the expences of the undertaking ; and who are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy all the advantages which Government may be willing to grant.</p>
         <p>These are our views–we conceive that they may be realized, if supported by an united and active co-operation of those who think like us in other parts of the Union. We are, therefore,
            desirous of adopting and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system to that co-operation ; namely, the formation of societies totally divested of all party or
            political feelings, and directing the attention only to this object. There are already a sufficient number of political institutions in every State, in which the zealous partizan (be his
            opinions what they may) can act on them to their fullest extent. Let these societies be neutral groun, or rather consecrated places, in which, when we meet, we lay aside all our
            hostilities, and join as brothers in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship. They are consecrated to every man amongst us, by the purity of their object, by our
            earliest recollections, by our unbroken affection, and our strongest sympathies– by the unextinguished love of our native land, for which most of us have already renounced all sectarian
            antipathies and religious animosities ; which we offer as a solemn pledge to the country of our adoption, that our hearts will be always alive, from temperament as well as principle, to
            the emotions of patriotism ; and that those amongst us who have pledged their faith to her, however they may seem to differ on some minor political subjects, will always be found firmly
            ranged and united under the same banners, and forming one phalanx whenever her more important interests are concerned.</p>
         <p>Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions, which being severally put, were carried with some slight amendments as follow :–</p>
         <p>1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen, for the purpose of endeavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the Illinois
            territory, to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. 2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing description, who shall, on or before the second day of December next, pay to the
            Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five dollars, shall be entitled to become a Member of the said Society, until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one hundred, after which
            time the subscribers shall be at liberty to elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be admitted except by ballot. 3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen, and the
            descendents of Irishmen, in the other cities and towns of the Union, to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and co-operating with that which is about to be formed in
            this city. 4. Resolved–That, as the meeting of Congress will shortly take place, and in order to prevent the less of time, a Committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a
            memorial to that body, to be submitted to the consideration of the Society, when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such measures as they may think expedient for promoting and
            accelebrating the organization of that Society.</p>
         <p>Mr John W. Mulligan, in seconding Mr Emmet's motion, expressed, in handsome terms, how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend, had given him the opportunity of claiming his
            title of descendent of an Irishman.</p>
         <p>A Committee was then appointed, pursuant to the fourth resolution, the number being, upon motion and discussion, augmented to twentyone.</p>
         <p>Committee –Andrew Morris, Thomas Addis Emmet, William Sampson, John W. Mulligan, Thomas Kirk, James Moffit, Robert Swanton, Matthew Carroll, William James M'Neven, Captain Skiddy, Dennic
            M'Carthy, John Meyher, James M'Bride, Cornelius Heeney, William Paterson, Colonel Mulaney, David Bryson, Captain O'Sullivan, James J. M'Donnell, Dennis H. Doyle, James Hayes.</p>
         <p>A subscription paper being then opened, a number of those present subscribed their names and paid five dollars as their initiation fee, and became members of the association. Those persons
            who wish to become original members may do so by signing their names and paying their subscription to the Secretary before 2d December, pursuant to the second resolution.</p>
         <p>After the meeting was adjourned, the Committee organized itself, and appointed Sub-Committees, to report a draft of a constitution and a memorial to Congress, and for the discharge of
            other requisite duties.</p>

         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a Mercantile House in Nova Scotia, to their Correspondents in this quarter.</p>
         <p>"We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in contemplation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into Great Britain and Ireland, from the British North American Provinces,
            equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign Timber in 1813 will be further suspended.</p>
         <p>"Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encouragement of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] bring us [?] at a low freight, whereby we are enabled to
            furnish the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?], and that on very moderate terms ; but, in the event of Government persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from
            hence, that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans, besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring Provinces.</p>
         <p>"The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother country, upon trial, will be found delusive ; to prove this, many obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists, all the
            Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ireland is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky an article as Timber, and the import of so ponderous an
            article as [?], employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any benefit they could possibly derive from direct
            Duties imposed on the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be denied that previous to 1813, when the additional Duty was laid on Foreign Timber, they (the Foreigners)
            were not only the carriers, but would not accept an ounce of British Manufacture in payment for their TImber–no, nothing but you gold[?] which was so much in demand, that 28s. was given
            for a [?]. Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provinces ; it facilitates emigration, and introduces many
            valuable settlers into this Province, and the Canadas, that would go to the States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when they would of accessity[?] become our
            enemies.</p>
         <p>"When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eastern countries, from whence the principal supply of Timber was derived, the merchants in that line[?], as well as the ship-masters
            were not only alarmed, but convinced themselves ruined ! The Baltic is shut[?], what shall we do for Timber, and with our ships? They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces
            could supply them ; they made the experiment, they were not disappointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If therefore, in time of war, Britain has took to her colonies for a
            supply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected, when blessed with peace."</p>
         <p>Extract of a Letter, dated Savannah, 25th Nov. 1817</p>
         <p>"In the Southern States, this autumn has been the most fatal they have experienced since their colonization. Many thousands have been hurried off to that " narrow house" destined for all
            that live. A most malignant fever has prevailed to an alarming extent. In this city, during the last four months, the deaths have been equal to one-eights of the inhabitants left in it ;
            and in Beaufort (S. Carolina) and in some of the Southern Counties, the morality has exceeded one-sixth!"</p>

         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft of a petition to the Prince Regent, founded on the resolutions adopted in the province of Niagara, where some discontent has been manifested. The
            first part is as follows:–</p>
         <p>"To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, &amp;c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper Canada</p>
         <p>May it please your Royal Highness,</p>
         <p>"The subjects of your Royal Father, dwelling in Upper Canada, should need no words to give assurance of their loyalty, if the whole truth had reached the throne of their Sovereign. His
            subjects have reason to believe that the truth has not been told.</p>
         <p>During three years of war, Upper Canada was exposed to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Government of the United States had been long concerting the invasion of this
            province. Hostile preparations against it had been long masked under other designs ; and at last the accumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless children of the British empire.
            Nor were they assailed by the weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded those host of the enemy, forgetful of honour, regardless of humanity, and daring to seduce the
            subjects of Britain from their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they rose against their invaders ; the invader would
            have spared to them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American standard been planted in Upper Canada, while yet but a
            handful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The second year of war saw Canada contending with yet little
            assistance from the parent state. The second year of the war saw her sons confirmed in their virtue, and still more determined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their homes ; the
            face of the country was laid waste, and the fire of revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; still was the spirit of the people unextinguished, still did it burn with
            patriotism and loyalty.</p>
         <p>"By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end, for now the British aid poured into the provinces, and peace was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared.</p>
         <p>"It is now more than three years since there was an end of war, but, strange to say, these years of peace have manifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother country to the
            Canadas. Commercial treaties have been made, altogether neglectful of British interests here. Government transactions, which used to give spirit to trade and are at a stand; troops are
            withdrawn ; fortifications are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the
            complains and grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of most important truths ; who are well assured of the generous
            disposition of your Royal heart, and of your desire that British subjects should every where share equally you paternal regard an affection.</p>
         <p>"It was a matter of much provocation to the people of the province to see, even during the war, which afforded such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour, reports went home highly
            rating the merits of regular troops, while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set down, may, the principles of the most loyal subjects here were often stigmatised by British
            officers, ignorant of human character, and still more so of circumstances which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Canadian
            worth, and his memory will happily long cherish, in the minds of the Canadian people, a due regard for the genuine spirit of a British solider, at once generous and brave.</p>
         <p>"The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain to notice the misrepresentations of individuals, so contrary to notorious truth, if these had not obviously conspired with other causes
            to lessen the regard which should subsist between British subjects here and at home, to influence the conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the province.</p>
         <p>"The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada suffered grievously during the war in their property, and many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on this subject took
            place ; the claims of the sufferers were authenticated, and there was every reason to expect that recompence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has followed but delay and insult.
            Surely if there is among mankind a single principle of justice, that is one, that the individuals of a nation ought not, partially, to bear the weight of public calamity. Surely
            individuals who have exposed their lives for Government should not be disgusted with finding Government regardless of those very principles which it is intended to sustain. The people of
            this province are well aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard with taxations, and far it is from their wish that relief should be afford from thence. Canada contains
            within itself ample means of exonerating Government from the claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your Royal Highness to remove, by a signle breath, the evil now
            justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie here at the disposal of your Royal Highness, upon the credit of which, under proper management, not only the fair claims of
            loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced, but vast sums could be raised for the improvement of the provinces, and the increase of revenue to Britain.</p>
         <p>"Another grievance, manifesting the neglect of Government to the concerns of Upper Canada, is equally notorious, and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of your Royal
            Highness.</p>
         <p>"The young men of this province, who were armed in its defence had, for their spirited conduct, the promise of their commanders, that land would be granted them as a reward for their
            services, as soon as war was terminated ; and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parliament of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law, in the face of established British
            principles, that militia should pass beyond the frontier. With these promises, and in obedience to this law, the militia passed beyond the frontier with alacrity ; yet since the peace, the
            greater part of them had been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services, and the land is unjudtly withheld."</p>
         <p>The petition further states that such ingratitude, such dishonour, such errors in policy, could not exist without extraordinary influences, and it recommends most important changes equally
            for the glory of the throne, and benefit of the subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous ingratitude, the the home Ministers wisely
            imposed restriction on the Land Council of Upper Canada. It seems, however, that all this was insufficient, and that confusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system. Upper
            Canada, it is now said, pines in comparative decay, and that discontent and poverty are experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature.</p>
         <p>It is insisted that the immediate interference of his Royal Highness might do much to remove the evils which spring from the system of patronage and favouritism, and it asserts that the
            interposition of the British Parliament is more imperiously required. It concludes as follows:–" Deeply penetrated with these sentiments, and most seriously inclined to have changes
            speedily effected, the loyal subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper Canada now take the extraordinary step of sending home Commissioners to bear this to the throne, and humbly intreat
            your Royal Highness to give ear to the details which it will be in their power to relate: above all, that your Royal Highness would immediately send out to this province a commission,
            consisting of discreet</p>
         <p>and wise men, men of business and talent, who shall be above every influence here, and who may be instructed to make inquiry into all the sources of evil.</p>

         <p>American Papers</p>
         <p>From the Trenton Federalist, June 8</p>
         <p>"The seizure, trial, and execution of two men, said to be British subjects, by our military folks, who lately invaded, the Spanish Territory, seems to be confirmed by accounts from the
            south, with a lament added thereto, that another of the same nation had not been catched and killed. If these accounts should prove true, I think the President will as good reason for
            recommending to Congress, at the next session, the abolition of the army, as he had at the last, for doing away the naval forces on the lakes– because it was more likely to involve us in
            war, than to give us security and peace. A little while ago we made quite a bluster and noise because the King of Spain had imprisoned one of our citizens at Cadiz; but the nation seems to
            rest very easy at present with the above named executions. Why?–because the wrong is committed by us, not against us."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter, dated Washington city, June 2. 1818:–" The British Consul-General, A. St. John Baker, is about to depart for Europe; the ostensible cause of his departure is the
            recovery of his health, but it is sufficient to look in his face to see that it is only a common diplomatic disease, which may be aggravated or cured at discretion ; the real object is
            diplomatic ; the English Cabinet has expressed some hesitation in regard to certain subjects in Mr Bagot's dispatches ; the speculation carrying on between the Spanish agents and some
            persons in this place opens a field of corruption so wide and comprehensive. Mr Baker goes prepared to state the facts, from his immediate knowledge ; for no man is better acquainted with
            men and things here.– The Chevalier Colonel Sarmiento is also preparing to visit Madrid, but his business appears to relate to mercantile affairs of some Americans on the west coast ; he
            received 27,000 dollars for one service of this king, but the object for which he received the douceur failed, and he will not refund."</p>

         <p>Washington, May 25, 1818. SIR–The act of Congress, "concerning navigation," hereto annexed, which is to take effect the first day of October next, so materially changes the commerce of the
            United States with the colonies and territories of Britannic Majesty, thata due regard to the convenience and interest of those engaged in it requires that the construction of the act
            should at this time be determined.</p>
         <p>According to the term used un ther the first section of the act, every port or place in the British colonies and territories in the West Indies, and on the continent of America, must be
            considered as closed against vessels of the United States, to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to carry on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is now, or
            shall be, carried on in British vessels between the ports of the United States and the ports of any British colony or territory.</p>
         <p>The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the United States to go in ballast to Turk's Island, and bring away salt, or to carry certain articles to one or more of the Bahama
            Islands, and bring away salt, and a few other articles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of those islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the intention of the
            act of Congress, whilst British vessels are permitted to carry on the same trade in articles prohibited to vessels of the United States.</p>
         <p>It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the first section applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or with cargoes.</p>
         <p>The form of the bond required by the second section of the act is hereunto annexed. It is expected that proper circumspection will be exercised in requiring a security, as much of the
            efficacy of the act will depend upon the judicious discharge of this part of your duty.</p>

         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>The inhabitants of Upper Canada have had another meeting, under the title of a Convention at York ; when they came to the following resolutions ; Richard Beasely, Esq. in the chair :–</p>
         <p>"Resolved–1. That whilst this Convention holds it one one of the most sacred right of British subjects at all times directly to petition the throne of their Sovereign relative to their
            grievances, yet nevertheless, under the present peculiar existing circumstances of this country, the Members of this Convention, as well out of respect to that Honourable Body the Commons
            House of Assembly of Upper Canada, as for other causes, deem it their indispensable duty, on this important occasion, to recommend in the strongest terms to their fellow subjects resident
            in this province, a spirit, formal, and respectful application to that Honourable House, for an inquiry into the state of the province.</p>
         <p>"2. That John Clarke Cyrus Sumner, and Roderick Drake, Esqs. be a permanent Committee, for the management of the affairs of the Convention, and that they, as soon as may be practicable,
            prepare a respectful petition, praying for inquiring, and expressive of grievances (for the sanction of this Convention), to be by them circulated for subscribers, and presented at the bar
            of the House of Assembly at their next meeting session.</p>
         <p>That the said Committee be further authorised to frame and Address to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, on the subject of grievances believed to exist in Upper Canada, which, when
            approved of by the Convention, shall be submitted by the Committee, together with the petition above mentioned, to the Honourable House of Assembly, at their next meeting, for their
            alterationg and amendment."</p>
         <p>Mr Gourlay, who has had so instrumental a hand in instigating these proceedings, is stated to have been arrested and held to bail, at Kingston, for distributing a printed account of the
            state of grievances of the people of the Niagara district ; and this by direction of the AttorneyGeneral of the province, who is reported to have influenced the Justice who signed the
            warrant, by certain threats of vengeance if he refused. Another report is mentioned as being in circulation, namely, that official instruction have been sent to particular Magistrates, to
            take notice of, and transmit to Government, the names of all persons holding commissions, civil or military, who engage in the measures of petitioning the Prince Regent, as recommended by
            Mr Gourlay, in order that they may be removed from their offices.</p>
         <p>"The Upper Canada Convention met at York on the 6th inst. under the Presidency of Richard Bearly, Esq. J. P. It has styled itself a Convention of Friends to Free Inquiry, and resolved to
            change the proposed plan of sending deputies to England with a petition to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, confining itself to an application to the House of Assembly for an inquiry
            into the state of the province, and a petition to his Royal Highness, to be presented to Sir Peregrine Maitland for transmission.– From the Quebec Gazette of July 31.</p>

      <titular>Emigration to America</titular>
      <texto>
         <p>Our paper of Thursday last contained a general view of some of the most popular publications on the subject of emigration, and we shall now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the
            good and evil which is likely to befall those who embark in this hazardous adventure.</p>
         <p>There is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of America, whether written for the purpose of praise or censure, namely, that there is a great demand for labour, and
            that wages are high, and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is
            this vacant territory which is the true spring of this American community. Here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states of America and of Europe. To
            cultivate this waste there is a constant demand for new labourers ; wages are, of course, high – the labourer lives in comfort, and, if he is industrious, he becomes in his turn a
            purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates. If labour should become more plentiful, and wages should fall, this is the signal for new emigrations ; and thus, this constant
            demand for labour in the western districts regulates its general price throughout the United States. In these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer, provided he can reach this
            advantageous market for his labour, will unquestionably improve his condition. But herein lies the difficulty. A labourer has seldom the means of of subsistence so far beforehand as to
            enable him to undertake so long a journey ; and, if he enters upon the enterprise with insufficient means, he is liable to starve before he can transport himself to his ultimate
            destination, or he is forced to contract, for immediate subsistence, obligations little short of servitude, under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed. These, then form strong
            objections to emigrations in the case of those who are stinted to their means ; but where these objections can be surmounted, those who can transport their labour from the overstocked
            market of Europe to the understocked market of America, will unquestionably dispose of it to better advantage ; but if they have not the means, they may as furely fail in the attempt, and
            draw upon themselves aggravated misery and want. As to the consequences of emigration to this country, we hold them rather to be beneficial than otherwise, and we cannot easily account for
            the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is, that every country is overcrowded with labourers, who cannot find employment ; and is it not
            manifest, therefore, that the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that remain – that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a relief to the body
            politic, and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through all its parts? That these effects will follow from emigration in this or in any other country in Europe we cannot doubt – and
            that the labourer, if he can afford the expence of the journey, will receive higher wages in America than in this country, is equally clear.</p>
         <p>There is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their circumstances by emigration, although this is not so certain, namely, farmers with a moderate capital. An allotment of
            land may be purchased in the back parts of America at the Government price of two dollars per acre, and an emigrant who can afford to but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres, and acts with
            proper judgement and skill, may undoubtedly, by a speculation of this sort, be sure of a subsistence, while, by the continued emigrations from the eastern states, the country being quickly
            settled all around him, his property is daily improving in value. But a want of judgement in the purchase, or a want of ability to cultivate the land after it is purchased, may involve him
            in irrecoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence is necessary.</p>
         <p>Such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration, and we shall now state some of its disadvantages. The first, and chief of these, is the difficulty of effecting a settlement,
            and of subsisting until the land which is purchased yields its first produce. The country is partly open ground, or prairie, as it is called, or it is covered with almost boundless
            forests. A settlement in the woods requires incredible labour to clear it – labour is dear, and not easily procured, and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of the family,
            who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of felling trees, and afterwards to follow the chace for a meal to his family. Here he must frequently sleep out in
            the woods ; and his body, exhausted with his day's labour, is exposed to the cold dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his health declines, and it is obvious that his family,
            deprived even for a single day of his exertions, must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. In many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely unhealthy, in
            particular the banks of all the navigable rivers, which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility and situation, are exposed to the most fatal maladies. The same
            causes which produce fertility produce disease. The overflowing of the waters, from the autumnal and spring floods, fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; but the exhalations of
            these stagnant waters, under a burning sun, are as fatal to the health as the deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil. Hence the many minute directions which are given to all
            emigrants in regard to their health. In a letter contained in the Emigrant's Guide, we have the following advice to those who are descending the Ohio : " If the weather becomes warm, guard
            well against the smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in the spring, go early – avoid all delay, and remember you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the havoc, and I believed
            it not till then." Again it is observed, " Let nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather, immediately on changing your climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison." To a European emigran
            the climate must be, of course, even more fatal ; and he either therefore lose his health, or he must be continually tormented with anxiously taking care of it, which makes it a question
            whether it is worth having on such terms. Such are the hardships through which, if he has strength to endure them, he at length emerges into ease and independence. These hardships,
            however, will no doubt be in a great measure avoided, or at least mitigated, if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular supplies from his own land.
            In this case he is less liable to be dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – He is secured against the hardships of a first
            settlement, and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence – To a farmer, therefore, or a labourer, emigration presents a fair chance of a permanent
            settlement, provided it is gone about with ordinary caution, and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure success. But it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium is to be
            found in the United States, or that mankind exist there on any more favourable terms than in this country, and those who set out on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a
            woeful disappointment. With regard to other classes of society, it does not appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to America ; there is no demand for clerks or
            professional men of any sort, and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the United States. In the back settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters to teach the
            ordinary branches of education, and several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement.</p>
         <p>In regard to the essential article of comfort, it is apparent, from all the best information on the subject, that a person long resident in this country would change for the worse by an
            emigration to the United States. He would, in the first place, suffer extremely from the climate, from the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat of summer, the thermometer frequently
            standing at 98 degrees in the share, with a clear sky and broiling sun, and very little abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the night. His frame, accustomed to the
            more temperate, though unsettled climate of this country, runs the risk of being debilitated by the change, and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in his spirit
            from this cause. Nor, we should imagine, would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all hands, both by those who are
            favourable and those who are unfavourable to the Americans, that if there is not, as in Europe, gross ignorance and debasement on the one hand, neither is there on the other any thing much
            exalted above the ordinary level. But the inferences which arise from this established fact are strongly in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and ignorance carries a sure antidote to
            its corruptions in the disgust which it excites : such examples are not so potent to debase, as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt. There is little risk that society will
            be contaminated by what is low and debased ; but on the other hand, there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature, science, taste, accomplishments, or fashion,
            will exercise a powerful influence on the general state of manners. We naturally copy what we admire, and those great and shining examples constitute a standard to which the whole system
            of life and manners has a tacit reference. In the United States they have no such models – they do not aim at so high a standard, and taste and manners are therefore necessarily at a lower
            ebb than in Europe – Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and Cobbett, who will be suspected of too great partiality to this
            country, draws a contrast between the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of the United States, in which he places this vice of the American manners in strong colours ; and he adds, as his
            reason for this, that they have no gentlemen's seats, with the fine improvements of pleasure grounds, &amp;c. dispersed through the country, as models of taste and neatness for the
            inferior classes, and it is to the same principles that we may trace other defects in their manners, namely, that they have no proper models on which to form themselves. Hence, excepting
            in the principal cities, we may safely conclude, from all the information we have received on the subject, that society has not reach the same degree of refinement as in this country.</p>
         <p>An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain would also feel the disavantages of American society strong in this, that here, in so closely peopled a community, surrounded with all sorts of
            refinements, life is assisted by such a variety of helps, that it glides down the smooth stream of comfort and convenience, without ever meeting with a single interruption. It is
            astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a society is brough, abounding in wealth and in all the mechanical arts, and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the rack to set
            on foot new devices for the common good. We are not duly sensible of the advantages of this, because, like other advantages, they are familiar to us by long habit, and we begin to imagine
            that they are inherent in the natural constitution of things. But when we are suddenly transplanted into a new community, abounding indeed in subsistence, but deficient in all comforts –
            where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised – where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed, that their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good, we find life
            interrupted at every turn. In our former society, if we had not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold, we had at least the power of transmuting gold into every thing
            else. But here the power of money is limited. We must indeed pay for services, but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty
            incommodities, which in this country would be remedied as soon as they were felt. It is inconceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real unhappiness may spring from this cause.
            In this country, by long habit and pracrice and continual improvement, every thing has fallen into its right place – each individual has a separate task assigned him in the joint task of
            labouring for the general benefit – and the industry of all, however variously directed, tends to one common end. There is a perfect unity of effort. We all labour in common – we combine
            our efforts that they may yield the largest possible produce, and this produce is accurately shared among the various members of the community, each receiving the share to which his labour
            entitles him. Such is substantially the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over every civilized community. – Money is the instrument by which this division is
            effected. Every one who labours has the value of his labour ascertained in money, which is a draft upon the common stock for whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to
            ; and all these complicated operations are executed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in a community newly forming there is a want of unity and combination – all the members labour
            indeed, but no one has his proper part assigned him – there is a jostling and an interference with each other – and when they come to divide, some have too much, and some too little, of
            certain articles – the stock is ill assorted, and money will not execute its functions. Hence disorder arises, and inconvience and awkward wants, and an individual suddenly removed into
            this region of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community, must be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and disagreeable. He must have the same
            sensation as a person who quits an elegant mansion, fitted up with every comfort and convenience, for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished, where he is exposed to a thousand
            annoyances every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson, that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and overwhelming crash of misery, but in a series of petty discomforts amd
            mischiefs continually preying upon the temper. The truth of this maxim, those who emigrate from this country to the back woods of America, will have a good opportunity of verifying.</p>
         <p>The prevalence of slavery in most of the States of the Union constitutes another capital defect in the structure of American society. These slaves form a degraded and oppressed class, and,
            in the tyranny exercised over them, they themselves are morally destroyed, while the corruption extends to the other orders of society, equally infecting the oppressed and the oppressor,
            and debasing the general character and habits of the people. It is vain to talk of liberty while stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of a community. There can be no
            rational liberty unless we call that liberty which gives us the privilege of torturing and oppressing our fellow creatures. To give an idea of the consequences of this dreadful evil of
            slavery, we may state, that it is a practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the public executioner, by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of
            the different towns, the streets being filled with their pietous cries. What can we think of the people where such spectacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so utterly revolting to
            every just and enlightened feeling, that to a European it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in that country. In all the northern states, and in some of the new
            states, particularly that of the Ohio, slavery is indeed abolished. But in several others the black form a large proportion of the population, and they are not decreasing. We know indeed
            that this evil is admitted in its full extent by all the American statesmen, that they lament it, but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it. The importation of new
            slaves is indeed prohibited, but the increase of those already in the country is the great grievance, against which it is difficult to devise a remedy, and the cruel and oppressive
            treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist, must tend to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large. To such, therefore, as are accustomed to
            European society, where no such strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners, an exchange into a community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruelty cannot be
            regarded as very desirable. If more imperious considerations permit, they have certainly a greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of nature are respected, than by
            removing to a society where every principle of humanity is trampled upon.</p>

      <titular>Interesting Communication from Canada</titular>
      <texto>
         <p>To the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly Journal</p>
         <p>SIR–It will be remember by many of your Readers, that, in the spring of 1815, proclamations were widely circulated, inviting settlers to Canada.–Having myself occasion to visit this
            country, I was curious to know what had been the result, especially as I found at Quebec and Montreal very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people asserting that the scheme had
            failed of success, and that the settlers were in a state of great discomfort and discontent.–To ascertain the truth, I diverged from my route about 50 miles, and spent some days at Perth,
            situated on the waters of the Redeau, to which a considerable body of the people who accepted the invitation of the Government had been conducted.– Here it traced the reported discontent
            to some neglect in the general management, and some ill conceieved petty regulations, capriciously exercised towards people tenacious of their rights ; but in the main, universal
            satisfaction prevailed among the settlers, and a strong feeling of the good intentions of Government towards them. The opportunity being a good one of ascertaining the progress which a
            promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I constructed the annexed table, and had each man's signature attached, at once to prove to correctness of his statement, and
            satisfaction with his situation. Should you think this worthy of publication, you are welcome to publish it in your paper. It may draw attention of a most important subject–the
            colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of their friends. The scheme which
            Government adopted in 1815 was expensive. The settlers had a free passage, rations and tools. Next year rations and tools were furnished to those who came out ; and this year multitudes of
            poor people have come to Canada, in expectation of being favoured in the same way, but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100 acres each), which many of them from
            poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study, during three months residence here, to inquire into the nature of the country, and into every particular respecting settlement, I am
            convinced that very simple measures might be adopted, by which the redundant population of Britain could be conveyed by a regular flow into Canada, instead of being wasted, as it now is,
            to the great prejudice of British interest, over the whole of American ; and were such measures adopted, this province would, in a very few years, be quite equal to its defence in war
            against the United States –I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c. Upper Canada, September 15. 1817 Robert Gourlay.</p>

         <p>Convicts destined for Botany Bay. –It is now seven weeks since the ten Derby convicts were sent off with several others, whose destination for the rest of their lives is Botany Bay. They
            were, upon landing at Sheerness from the Retribution, put on board the Tottenham, which was engaged to land them at their place of punishment. The number on board that ship, on leaving
            Sheerness, was between 2 to 300, many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their condition has been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay that has taken place. The ship
            Tottenham had not proceeded farther than the Downs when she lost her rudder, by some accident or other. She returned to Sheerness, where she now lies, and where she is likely to lie for
            some time, upon the pretence that the loss she has sustained is a justification for delay, however protracted. The unfortunate inmates have been led to expect that some important
            mitigation of their sentence has taken place ;–so that between the suspense, and the terrible species of confinement to which they are subject, their sufferings are hardto be described.–
            Observer.</p>
         <p>The Hon. Lieut.-Colonel Erskine. –It is with the greatest concern we have to mentioned the death of Lieut.-Colonel Erskine, Lord Erskine's youngest son, on his passage to Ceylon. He served
            throughout the campaigns in Spain as a Captain of Light Infantry in the 51st regiment, and behaved with great gallantry in the battle of the Pyrenees, where being shot in the thigh he was
            sent home by the Medical Board, and on his recovery was placed by the Duke of York on the Staff of the Army in the Adjutant-General's Department when the Duke of Wellington took the
            command in Flanders. He was in the battle of the 16th of June, and afterwards on the 18th at the battle of Waterloo, where his station placed him in the dangerous position of being
            attendant on the Duke, around whom almost every officer was either killed or wounded. Amongst the rest this brave young man had his left arm carried off by a cannon-ball, which passing
            along the other laid bare the whole of it, by which he lost the use of two of his fingers, but that arm was saved. When the cannon-shot had thrown him from his horse, and as he lay
            bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition, the Prussian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance, he seized his hat with his remaining shattered arm. and waving it round him
            cheered his companions in the midst of the dying and the dead, the Duke of Wellington being then close by him who desired he might carried to his tent.</p>
         <p>It must be some consolation to his afflicted family, that he must have distinguished himself in the opinion of his great Commander, as he was immediately recommended by him for the rank of
            Major, though a very young officer, and in a year afterwards to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, with the appointment of Adjutant-General in Ceylon, and if he had then fortunately sailed
            for India his life might probably have been saved ; but his disposition being as affectionate as it was animated, he could not be persuaded to leave Mrs Erskine, who was pregnant, and
            remaining here during the winter, the cough, with consumptive symptoms, arising from his wound, laid too deep a hold on him to derive benefit from the voyage, and he died on his passage to
            India.</p>
         <p>Colonel Erskine was only 25 years of age, and has left three sons and a daughter, and an infant a few months old.</p>
         <p>The marriage of the Duke of Clarence with the rich heiress Miss Wykeham is said to be finally arranged ; and from what we observe, it is not likely to suffer any delay from the late
            domestic calamity. it is said that the Prince Regent has given his own personal assent ; but whether it has passed through the constitutional forms, and that the Royal Assent in Council
            has been given we do not pretend to know. It must have that sanction to secure the Lady the right, for herself and heirs, of succeeding to the Throne. On this interesting subject it cannot
            be forgotten, that King in Council refused his assent in three former instances.</p>
         <p>The refusal of the Princess Royal of Denmark arrived in town on Monday or Tuesday last week. On Wednesday it was communicated to his Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence, and on Thursday he
            set off to Brighton, offered his hand to Miss Wykeham, and " was a thriving wooer."</p>
         <p>Colonel Henry Fitzclarence, the son of the Duke of Clarence, lately deceased, was a young man of uncommon energy of character, and of talents and acquirements. In the affair of the 10th
            Light Dragoons, he displayed a spirit of independence and manliness the most honourable. He was an admirable linguist, and, as we understand, was about to return to England, with the view
            of being employed in the Diplomacy, for which he was peculiarly qualified.</p>

         <p>Death of The Duke of Richmond.</p>
         <p>By the Henry, arrived in the rive from Quebec, we have advices from thence of the 4th September, three days later than the last accounts. They confirm, we regret to say, the intelligence
            received at Lloyd's on Friday, of the death of the Duke of Richmond, at Montreal, where he had arrived on his return from inspecting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His body had been
            brought from Montreal to Quebec, where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sailed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox, continued in the most afflicting state, and great fears were
            entertained for her recovery.</p>
         <p>Lady Sarah Lennoc, his Grace's second daughter, is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. They accompanied his grace to North America, and have remained there since he entered
            upon his Government. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the first Duke of Richmond, natural son of King Charles II. by a French Lady, who was created by his Majesty Duchess of
            Portsmouth, and by Louis the Fourteenth, Duchess of Aubigny, in France. His titles were, Duke of Richmond, Early of March (English honours) ; Duke of Aubigny, (French Honour) ; Duke of
            Lennox, Early of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was confirmed in March 1816, by Louis XVIII by causing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned
            to him, and granting him the honours of the Louvre, as enjoyed by his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General in the army, Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot, Gonervor of
            Plymouth, Governor of Upper and Lower Canada and their dependencies, Lord Lieutenant of the county of Sussex, and High Steward of Chichester. –His Grace was born in 1764, succeeded his
            uncle, Charles, the late Duke, in 1806, and married in 1783 Charlotte, daughter of Duke of Gordon, by whom he had issue seven sons and seven daughters, all of them now living, except his
            third son, Henry Adam, R. N. who fell overboard the Blake, as she was sailing into Port Mahon, in 1812, and was drowned. His Grace was distinguished early in life by a duel with His Royal
            Highness the Duke of York. He was of an open, candid, generous temper, and of plain and unaffected manners, qualities which were particularly conspicuous in Ireland, when Viceroy of that
            country.</p>
         <p>His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest son Charles, Earl of March, now Duke of Richmond. This young Nobleman in the army, has seen much active service under the personal auspices
            of the illustrious Wellington, being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp, and was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the City of Chichester, which seat, of course, becomes vacant.
            He was lately married to the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Anglesea, and has issue, a Son, now Earl of March.</p>
         <p>The following is extracted from the Quebec papers:</p>
         <p>"Quebec, Thursday, Sept. 2. "This Province has again been visited by one of those afflicting dispensations of Providence, which by separating by the hand of death, the ruler from the
            people, covers whole communities with mourning.</p>
         <p>"An express arrived here yesterday morning from Montreal, with the afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace the Duke of Richmond, Governor in Chief of these Provinces, had died on his
            way from Kingston to Montreal, at the moment that he was hourly expected to join his family there, from which he had separated in good health at Kingston, one the 20th, to complete by
            visiting the new Settlements, the long and arduous journey in which he has been engaged.</p>
         <p>This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelligence, spread with the greatest rapidity, and impressed a deep gloom throughout the city. The flag on the citadel, and on all the vessels in
            the port, was hoisted half-mast, exhibiting every where the signals of public mourning.</p>
         <p>"His Grace's body, immediately after his death, was conveyed to Montreal. It reached this city last evening in the steam-boat Malsham, and was removed this forenoon to the Castle, with the
            usual military honours, and followed by his Grace's Staff, the principal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Garrison, and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants."</p>
         <p>September 5. "His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal to Quebec, in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock, one the morning of the 2d of Sept. they were removed from the vessel, and placed
            upon a hearse upon the King's Wharf at Quebec, from whence it was conveyed to the Chateau of St. Louis, where they lay in state until four o'clock on Saturday the 4th September, when they
            were removed to the place of internment in the Cathedral Church at Quebec.</p>
         <p>"On the corpse being brought out, the collar and insignia of the Order of the Garter, with his Grace's military and other appointments being placed on the coffin, the whole of the troops
            presented arms. On its being placed on the hearse, the troops rested on their arms reversed.</p>
         <p>"The procession then moved forward. It was composed of all the principals persons attached to the public, military and civil departments.</p>
         <p>"The military band filed off at the door of the Cathedral Church-yard and conducted it up the centre aisle, when it was played on a platform, the mourners remaining by the body. A signal
            was then given, when the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter, dated Quebec, Sept 5 :–" When I wrote the first side, I did not expect so soon to communicate the melancholy event of the death of our Governor, the Duke of Richmond,
            who was attacked on his route from Upper Canada, with symptoms of hydrophobia, which terminated his mortal career at six miles from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly sensible of
            his situation, and gave himself up from the first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by a bite of a tame fox at Sorel, on his way to Upper Canada, about three months since. His
            death, at this juncture, is looked on as very unfortuante for this country, as he possessed the entire confidence of Government, and was about completing a plan of defence for the Canadas,
            which, when executed, would establish a water communication with our extreme points, perfectly free from interruption, in case of a war with the States."</p>
         <p>We are happy to learn, further, that no part of his Grace's family was so dangerously ill, as was at first reported. They are only in that situation which might be expected, from so severe
            an affliction.</p>
         <p>Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Richmond as Governor-General of both Canadas, being the senior Officer on that station.</p>
         <p>Sir Charles Saxton, and Major M'Leod, Aides-deCamp to his Grace the Duke of Richmond, have gone to Lake Winnipeg, clothed with special powers, to investigate the causes of the unhappy
            dissentions which are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter between the North West and Hudson's Bay Company. By the new act, regulating the commercial intercourse between the
            province of Upper Canada and the United States, the duties on the importation of manufactures and provisions from the States are considerably reduced on [?] of the enumerated articles,
            although on nails, snuff, manufactured tobacco, and spirits, they are riased. The ad-valorem[?] duty is reduced from 10 to 5 per cent.</p>
         <p>Buffalo, Aug. 4. On Friday, came[?] on before the Court of King's Beach, at Niagara, the trial of Robert Gourlay, Esq. for a misdemeanour, in not obeying the orders of the Magistrates at
            Niagara, in December last. Mr Gourlay was found guilty, and banished the province.</p>
         <p>From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August: This morning, about 9 o'clock, Lieut. Birch, of the royal navy, put a period to his existence by shooting himself through the head. We are informed
            that Mr Birch had for sometime previous to his death laboured under a melancholy state of mind. An amiable[?] wife and one child are the survivors[?] of this awful [?] The Annual Report of
            the Agricultural Society of Quebec has been published from which it is evident that a laudable spirit of enterprise has been awakened in that important country. The Committee, who, in the
            execution of their functions travelled through the greater part of Lower Canada, conclude their Report by putting on record a testimony they justly conceive to be honourable to the
            character of the inhabitants of the country through which they passed. Although many hundreds of persons from all parts of their respective Counties attended the Agricultural Meetings,
            which were frequently of four or five hours duration, there did not occur at any of them a single instance of intoxication, disorderly conduct or personal altercation.</p>
         <p>The Grand Jury at Nassau, New Providence, have brought in a bill against Sir Gregor M'Gregor, charging him with aiding and abetting piracy, by issuing commissions in the Bahamas, to
            subjects of Power in unity[?] with Spain.</p>
         <p>A letter from Sierra Leone, dated the 9th of March says–" It is with the deepest regret I inform you that, notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain, and the faith of Treaties, the
            coasts swarms with slave vessels, dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here the Union, of Liverpool : the Supercargo states, that
            during his stay in the river Calabia, not less than eight vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sailed for the Spanish Colonies."</p>
         <p>We have received Gibraltar Chronicles to the 10th ult. from which we learn that, in consequence of the rapid increase of the fever at the Isle de Leon, his Excellency Governor Don had
            issued a Proclamation on the 2d ult. announcing that all communications with Spain (except through the customary process of quatine) would close at sun-set on the following evening. Notice
            was also given to such of the labouring classes as had not passed the fever, that they would be provided with tents and encamped on the neutral ground for their better security against
            infection should it unhappily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered to proceed to town, and follow their callings, during the day, but heir return to the encampment at night
            was peremptorily enjoined.</p>
         <p>We are happy to learn, however, by the latest advices from the British fortress, that the garrison and inhabitants were not at all infected with the disease.</p>

      <titular>Emigration to America.</titular>
      <texto>
         <p>In answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last, respecting emigration to America, and to the statements there given of the disadvantages which emigrants from this
            country might expect to meet with, we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent, who appears very angry, and, like most other angry men, seems more anxious to
            give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause of quarrel is, that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back
            parts of the United States. For this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: –</p>
         <p>' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching, in a rude manner, as I pass along, ' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de' formity so general, that I cannot help
            esteem' ing it national, though I know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions. I have written ' it, and then erased it, wishing to pass it by, ' but it wont do – it is the truth,
            and to the truth ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too ' often in person, is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman.</p>
         <p>' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building, and that again
            for ' a mansion of brick, some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have ' already been quitted, and one by one they will ' all be cleared away, as I am told they
            are now ' in the cities of the eastern states.</p>
         <p>' There are, I believe, court-houses, which ' are also made us of as places of worship, in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built. What reverence '
            can be felt for the majesty of religion, or of ' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad
            ' public example. It is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life
            prevails ' through such a community?'</p>
         <p>To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads, and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck
            ' complains of this, and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild' ford, in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give
            the reasons for this. When the first settlers took possession of the country, the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as '
            drawing-rooms, with grass as even as a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these '
            matters, will naturally be slovens.'</p>
         <p>He afterwards remarks –</p>
         <p>' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without ' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven ' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, '
            who came from this very spot, think the people ' dirty in the western country. I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours, than he
            left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania, and especially in those parts
            where ' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in ' the New England States, the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. ' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu'
            trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature.'</p>
         <p>In answer to all this, our correspondent tells us, that the Scotch are very dirty. This, we admit, was formerly, and may still continue in some degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch.
            But does this reasonable person mean to argue from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and ought not to be corrected.</p>
         <p>With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement, we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers, and principally by the autheor of the
            Emigrant's Guide, a work of great merit, which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally, with the most enlarged general views of the state of the
            country, both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United ' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are
            the security of ' person and property, and the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour, severe economy, ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to ' succeed in a newly
            settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.'</p>
         <p>Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the Americans by the existence of slavery
            ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think
            proper to state. To show, however, that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the United States, we shall again adduce the authority of the
            Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the following terms: –</p>
         <p>' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent, enables us to contradict a ' general expression, that, in such places, whites, ' performing manual labour, are confounded
            in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites, yet
            ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject, that ' not any where in the United States can
            pro' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other ' advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' African, to a rank equal to the meanest
            white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in
            the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.'</p>
         <p>What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand, and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth, whether moral or
            intellectual, not even the possession of property, can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot conceive a community more wretchedly
            constituted. All that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned, because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour, and thus a
            merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt. These distinctions, carried to such an excess, seem to us to be
            founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment, and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are, than in a community where such hateful
            antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling.</p>
         <p>With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading which, we shall leave our anonymous
            correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer, describing the town of Lexington, in Kentucky,
            observes –</p>
         <p>' In this square stands the market-house, ' which is of brick, and well furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here '
            that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I ' could
            not help saying to myself, " These cries ' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' "</p>
         <p>Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us, we have only to disclaim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish
            either to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness. To revile such a
            people would be the height of human folly, and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character, without hiding
            any of its defects.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence York, (U.C.) Nov, 4.</p>
         <p>Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company.</p>
         <p>On Friday, the 30th of October, the Court of Oyer and Terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple, Esq. and others at Red River, on the
            19th of June, 1816 and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the disclousure which took place of many extraordinary circumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya and North West
            Companies, which for some time past has excited so much of the public attention in this Province. The gentlemen tried on this occasion were, Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie, Hugh M'Gillis,
            Simon Fraser, John Macdonald, and John M'Laughlin } accused as accessories after the fact. and Mr John Severlight, accused as an accessory before and after the fact.</p>
         <p>It appeared in evidence that the North West Company had been upwards of thirty years in possession of trading posts called forts at different points on the Red River in the Indian
            Territories, and it is well known that for a century before the North West Company, the Canadian for traders had been in the constant practise of resorting to that country which was
            visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was put in evidence that for many years afterwards both companies carried on their trade
            to Red River without interference in each others pursuits, and without any disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that the principal object of the trade being to collect
            provisions, (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buffalo, which abound in the plains) and the country producing abundance for the supply of both parties, the same causes of
            dissention did not exist as at trading stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quantities, and where rival traders would at all times be likely to dispute about the divisions of
            them. The Red River country therefore remained quiet and undisturbed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists and Servants, and the attempts made by their leaders to prevent
            the usual supplies of provisions from being obtained by the traders.</p>
         <p>The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-disant Governor of Ossinibour, prohibiting the exportation of provisions from Red River, was the first document produced for the defence at the
            recent trials. It was proved that, under this assumed authority, several acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and his followers. Trading posts and buildings were forcibly
            entered, depots of provisions seized, the river (the only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries mounted with cannon, and the trade of the North West Company wholly interdicted,
            before any acts of retaliation were attempted on their part, and even before they took any precautions for their own defence or for ensuring the safety of their provisions, on which
            depended the existence of their trade, and the lives of their people.</p>
         <p>Mutual and continual acts of aggression and retaliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both parties, and to have rendered them so suspicious of the designs of each other as to
            be always on their guard and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in evidence that the country remained in a state of private war, which at length ended in the battle of the loch of
            Jane, 1816. The particulars of this unfortunate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche and Brown for murder, as principals. The statements on both sides are already before
            the public, and the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories the
            cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hostile parties were made out in the evidence to the following effect, viz : –</p>
         <p>In March, 1816, Mr Colin Robertson, with an armed party, acting under the orders of Governor Semple, who had succeeded Governor Miles Macdonnell at Red River, captured by surprise the
            North West trading post at the forks of the river, called Fort Gibraltar, and took possession of all the stores and provisions. In the latter part of the following month of May, Governor
            Semple caused the buildings (which were of wood) to be taken to pieces, and the materials were floated fown the river in rafts, to be used in constructing his new fort, which he called
            Fort Douglas and where, (following the examples of his predecessors) he mounted cannon to command the passage of the river, built an armed schooner, or gun-boat, to complete the blockage,
            and effectually to intercept the provisions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. Alexander Macdonnell, a partner of the North West Company, who had charge of their provisions at
            Riviere Qui Appele, one of the branches of the Red River, became alarmed at these measures of hostility, and assembled as many people as he could (half breeds and others) for the
            protection of the property under his care, with which, at the usual time, he proceeded down the river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor Semple's fort. He then landed his
            provisions, made dispositions to defend them, if attacked, and sent a party of his people, with a temporary supply to meet the canoes from below, apprise them of the blockages, and concert
            with them the means of eluding or removing it. This party, under the direction of Cuthbert Grant (a half breed, and a clerk of the N. West Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas
            in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon, and to carry these provisions in carts, at as great a distance as possible from the fort, so as to avoid being seen.– This it was fully
            proved they did ; but a swamp in the rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about two miles of it, and being deserted and pursued from then, the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple,
            and most of his party, were killed.</p>
         <p>It was further made out in evidence that in the Spring of the year 1816, the agent of the North West Company at Montreal were still in need of more than the usual supply of provisions from
            the Red River, because there had not yet been time to replace the vessels on the lakes, and the other means of transport which the Americans had destroyed during the war, nor to replenish
            their stores at Fort William, with the usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red River in the fall of the year 1815, and
            apprehending further aggressions in the spring, Mr M'Leod, one of the agents, with all the partners and clerks who could be spared from Montreal, proceeded up the country early in the
            Spring, and on arriving at Fort William, received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar and the blockade of Red River, towards which place he immediately proceeded with as many of
            the partners, clerks, and servants of the Company as he could collect by the way, in order to rescue the intercepted provisions, in the defence of which, or in their own defence, if fired
            on by Semple's blockading battery, it was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary, but it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders issued to their cannonmen, were, to
            pass Fort Douglas singing, and to proceed up the river for their provisions, without landing or molesting any one unless they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River three days after
            the battle, and Mr M'Leod, who was a Magistrate, being of opinion that Mr Semple's party had been the assailants, and that the half breeds had only acted in self defence, did not adopt any
            measures against them, (the half breeds) but, on the contrary, expressed approbation for their having defended their provisions, and gave them the supplies of clothing, &amp;c. usually
            given to all the servants of the North West Company, while, at the same time, he arrest some of the survivors of Mr Semple's party, and served subpoenas upon others to give evidence of
            these transactions in the Courts of Lower Canada. This was the whole of the evidence, and the only circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners, were that Mr Sevewright (the
            alleged accessory before the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions past Fort Douglas, and that the alleged accessaries after
            the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod, after the battle was over, and appeared to consider it, as it is now found to have been, an affray in which the unsuccessful party were to
            blame, and in which the successful party were not murderers –The Judge who presided at the trial, declared in his charge to the jury that there was not a scintilla of evidence " against
            any one of these gentlemen," and the jury accordinagly returned a verdict of Not Guilty.</p>
         <p>It will be recollected that these gentlemen were arrested by the Earl of Selkirk, at Fort William, in Aug 1815, on the charges of High Treason and Conspiracy, as well as Murder–and that
            the buildings and property of the North West Company at that place were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an armed force under his Lordship's command. The North West Company
            represented at the time that these accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the preconcerted plunder of their property, and destruction of their trade, while, on the part of
            Lord Selkirk, it was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners of the North West Company were so atrocious, as to justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and for some
            time the public opinion remained in suspense as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded the seizure of property and the interruption of trade, the point was decided by the
            Prince Regent's Proclamation of the 3rd of May, 1817, in consequence of which the North West Company recovered possession of their property, and re-established their trade ; but that
            proclamation left the rights of parties, and the crimes alleged against the individuals, to be investigated and decided upon by the law – and until such investigation could take place,
            much uncertainty necessarily prevailed from the contradictory statements and affidavits which had been laid before the public.</p>
         <p>The recent trials at York however decided the point as to the alleged murders, and the charge of High Treason has never been followed up, nor ever mentioned, since it served the desired
            purpose, by figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for seizing and examining the books and private papers of of the North West Company.</p>

         <p>Reform in Upper Canada</p>
         <p>It has been already mentioned that Governor Maitland, on opening the session of the Legislature of Upper Canada, recommended that measures should be taken to prevent the meeting of
            delegates for obtaining reform in Upper Canada. Accounts from Quebec and Montreal, dated the end of November, state, that in pursuance of this recommendation, the Legislature, on one of
            the first days of its meeting, appointed a Committee to inquire into the subject, who almost instantly came to the following resolution</p>
         <p>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wisdom of the Imperial Parliament has found it proper to provide to meet
            similar occasions, to put it out of the power of any designing persons to organize discontent.</p>
         <p>The proceeding appears to have raised the indignation of the Gourlay or reforming party in Upper Canada, as will be seen by the following extract :–</p>
         <p>Montreal, November 21. This legislative provision, it will be immediately perceived, is the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act, for that was the course pursued in England. We do not
            believe that there is the most remote necessity for such a measure. We do not hesitate to say, that the members have not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents, in their echo of Sir P.
            Maitland's speech, with the most humiliating servility ; and we feel convinced that it will not be borne with by the people, while they have the control in any way of their
            representatives. The sentiment therein attempted to be disseminated is an libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. It would sound in our ears like the knell of their liberty, if we
            were not persuaded, that its adoption would provoke a spirit of resistance, not corporal, but mental ; not secret and illegal, but open and legitimate, which (if the Administration do not
            take the decision of the question from the people by force, and we believe they cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the constitution of the united province from the injury which it
            has received by mal-administration.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence. Halifax, March 13.</p>
         <p>A very numerous and respectable meeting of the inhabitants of this town was held at the Exchange Coffeehouse, on Saturday last, George Grassie. Esq. to the Chair. It was resolved
            unaminously–That the Legislature be petitioned to authorise the establishment of a bank in Halifax.–That 50,000l be the capital, to be invested in the British funds.–That notes to the
            amount of 150,000l be issued by the Bank.–That the shares be 100l each, and every five shares, according to a classification, entitled to a vote.–That the Bank be authorised to pay notes
            presented, either in specie, provincial paper, or bills of exchange on London at the current rate – A Committee was then appointed to prepare the Petition, and cause it to be presetned to
            the Legislature. The gentlemen present immediately afterwards unanimously agreed to give to the doubloun the value of 4l and to the sovereigh the value 1l, 2s. 6d. currency. The meeting
            then adjourned.</p>
         <p>York, Upper Canada, Feb. 6. Tex v. The Earl of Selkirk and others</p>
         <p>A bill of indictment, for a conspiracy to ruin the trade of the North West Company, and impoverish the partnes thereof, was found by the Grand Jury, against Thomas Douglas, Early of
            Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de Lorimer, Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens, late of the De Meuron Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey, ditto ;
            Lieutenant G. A. Fauche, ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick Graffenrad, ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie, ditto ; Captain Miles Macdonnel, late of the Canadian Fecibles ; Lieutenant Alexander
            Bridport Beecher, late of the Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen, John Spencer, Donald Macpherson, James Chatelain, John M'Nab, Archibald Macdonald, and John P. Bourke.</p>
         <p>The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst the numerous overt acts therein set forth, supported by documentary and oral evidence, the following were particularly prominent :– The
            engaging and armind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, in August, 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till May 1817 ;
            sending off as prisoners the partners of the North West Company found there ; getting rid of the clerks, by subpoenas to appear at York at a period when no courts are held there, without
            ever inquiring whether they know anything of the matters to which the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going into the
            interior, and the returns from coming into Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and papers of the concern ; sending away the principal clerk under a charge of felony, without
            examination, and without having ever followed up the charge ; the pretended sale, by Daniel Mackenzie, of the North West property, obtained by his Lordship by means of continued duress ;
            tampering with, and debauching the North West Company's servants, and commanding them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to the partners and clerks in the interior country,
            advising them to abandon their trust, alleging that the North West Company were ruined, and to carry the furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake La Pluie, and the property
            there, and stopping the navigation, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Upon this being returned a true bill the AttorneyGeneral moved the process of the Court against the parties ; and Dr Allen being present, was to be arraigned the following day.</p>
         <p>Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk</p>
         <p>This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment.</p>
         <p>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was undersheriff of the Western District, and as such, the bearer of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a special jury at Sandwich,
            in October 1816, and granted by the Magistrate, ordering the restoration of Fort William to the North West Company. He was also the bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his
            Lordship, Dr Allen, Captain Matthey, and others, upon an information upon oath before a justice of the Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of March 1817, and produced his writ
            of restitution, with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith, upon the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him and pushed
            him out of doors ; and he was afterwards kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. A circumstance which added much to the grievous nature of the offence, and which was
            particularly dwelt upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement, Charles de Reinhard, though under an accusation of was at
            large and keeping a school, though nominally under the surveillance of one or two of his former comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon another part of the evidence for the defence,
            by which it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to obtain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and breaking his oath of office, by a promise not to molest Lord Selkirk.
            Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his Lordship and his forces in May, 1818.</p>
         <p>The Jury after some deliberation, returned a verdict in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax currency.</p>
         <p>After narrating the military parages, &amp;c. at Richmond, in America, in honour of the 22d of February, a journal says, " A melancholy catastrophe closed the day. Colonel W. Tatham, so
            well known in England and this country, for his acquaintance with civil engineering.–who has been residing in this city for two or three years, but whose utility was considerably arrested
            by an unfortunate habit to which he had become addicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– In a moment of intemperance, as he stood by the piece of artillery which was firing
            the evening salute, he exclaimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was about to fire, and immediately after the commanding had given the word " Fire!" Conolonel Tatham presented
            himself in front of the muzzle of the piece, and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the air by the explosion, and he fell
            upon his face without uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circumstances had strip life of much of its attractions in his eyes ;
            but it is impossible not to regard the manner of his death with horroer, and to feel the deepest commiseraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of great information, of great genius,
            and of great resource of mine. But to this melancholy end he has arrived."</p>

         <p>Leeds, April 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day, though no bad consequences have followed, by a most numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and other artisans and
            labourers out of employment. They kep coming in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Armley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one
            time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands, they created some
            little alarm, but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power,
            were in readiness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number of the assemblage
            dispersed by noon, and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them, to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does
            not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I understand that an
            active subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay, provided they can obtain
            the sanction of Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.</p>
         <p>Chester, April 19.–John Bagguely, John Drummond and Samuel Johnson, convicted of sedition on the 15th inst., were this day, after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr Serjeant Copley,)
            sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and to find security for their good behaviour for two years, each in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each.</p>
         <p>We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire, and that the amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigration to America
            still continues; but it is, for the most part, of a description of person who have afforded employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some property with
            them.</p>
         <p>Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there are twenty six persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of the name of Thistlewaith,) lately residing in Meadow lane, Leeds.
            These industrious and enterprising individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale, either at Philadelphia
            or some other more eligible site in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, Bradford, and other places in the
            vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may, in some degree, contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the
            nation ; as every individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and
            industry–articles, at present, of comparative small value in the country.</p>
         <p>The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and publishers, by being compelled, under the existing Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book published to
            certain public libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of Commons last
            year, forms a most interesting display of the state of literary property in this country.</p>
         <p>Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of Camelford.</p>
         <p>Yesterday, the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of the
            petitioner, who were examined before the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn.</p>
         <p>Extraordinary Legacy. –A very singular cause is now depending before the Court of Session in Scotland, respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty thousand pounds, bequeathed by
            the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a foreigner, who was one of his domestic servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl, on the ground that
            it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The arguments and pleadings in
            this extraordinary suit, in which the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been pronounced by
            the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in dispute, it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– Morn. Chron.</p>
         <p>Town Hall, Southwark. –Thomas Wing was brought up by Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], the sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his employers,
            Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough, High-street.</p>
         <p>The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors, and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money
            from the till, which he tied in his pocket handkerchief, followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables, and then he came into the shop and appeared quite
            restless, pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the stable, the dog followed him,
            and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it to his master,
            who counted, and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot, which he did, and soon afterwards, finding that it was removed,
            he asked the prisoner some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent for, who, on searching the prisoner, found some
            of the marked ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee. –The Opposition Journals, last wek, asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of Commons intend to
            report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, any quanitity of notes not
            being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth, and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold, L.3, 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's
            plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all times buy gold, when offered, at
            L.3, 17s. and sell it, when demanded, at L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d.</p>
         <p>If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt that
            plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage, the waste of, &amp;c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign
            commerce, will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, will be
            completely prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England, and would
            cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Opposition Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in perfect security, at
            perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it. If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin, or content themselves with silver.</p>
         <p>In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800,000 each year, and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we imported to the
            amount of six millions, and in the year 1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an abundant harvest or
            two, and little importation of corn become necessary, gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay, to buy gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan, and to place
            their notes on a firm, unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent, and of the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will, during peace, gradually become steadier
            and better known. The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her troubles, yields far less than usual. It would be
            madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances, by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain, yet liberal
            amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?] is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone
            in voting against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments, or Mr Tierney would not have voted against it
            ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. –

         <p>Grand Pigeon Match, three Gentlemen of the Midgham Club, against thrice of All England, took place on Monday on Farnham Downs, at twenty-one birds, twenty-one yards distance from the gun,
            for 150 guineas aside, charge unlimited. Messrs Adams, Russel and Holt, were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King, Short and Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed
            nineteen birds, and the remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but lost one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, making a grand total of fifty-two from
            sixty-three. The Club was at first backed to win, but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four, as they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King killed twenty, but
            lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three, which brought betting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed the next seventeen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen
            to tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. He, however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the other
            four to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this sort known for years.</p>
         <p>Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that Prince Gustavus of Sweden, son of King Gustavus IV., has obtained permission from the Emperor, his uncle, to proceed to England,
            for the purpose of completing his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest and sympathy in the
            north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of Vasa was connected, not the services rendered by two
            Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate, whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial, has settled upon
            Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per annum, during the residence of the latter in England, and that on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is to espouse
            his cousin, a Princess of Hesse Cassel, who, if rumour be correct, has lately refused a matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty.</p>
         <p>Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer, in an article occupying five columns, under the head of "Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on
            the Seminole War," defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United States, being supposed to express
            the sentiments of the Executive. The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee. By an arrival from Aux Cayes, intelligence was stated to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's
            troops had deserted him, owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.</p>

         <p>Some Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in town. Sir Peregrine Maitland had summoned the Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York, on the 22d of April. He had appointed Port
            Talbot in the town of Dunwich, a port of entry, in the same manner as those established between Canada and the United Statess.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town, dated Tobago, Feb. 9. 1819.–' The heavy rains which continued during the months of December and January, almost inundated the country,
            which brought on a most rapid and fatal disease, which made its first appearance in the frost, at a short distance from the town, consisting of 212 men strong, and in 10 or 12 days, 45 of
            that number were numbered with the dead. The contagion was so rapid, that it soon spread into the town, shipping, and country, and proved equally fatal. The disorder was such, it baffled
            all medical aid. The alarming symptoms were such, that business was nearly suspended–the white population seeking safety in other islands, or in the remote and healthiest part of this. I
            assure you, that every thing had a most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so contagious, one man would hardly venture to touch another. The William's crew, from their mutinous
            disposition, deserted her–some have since died ; and some remain sick. The weather has become good within these fifteen days, and the health of the island improving fast.'</p>
         <p>A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes, to the 20th of February, have reached us. They contain no intelligence of particular interest, expect that the colony appears to have been healthy at
            that period. In one of them we find a contradiction of the reports which found their way into the English papers some months since of the dreadful mortality that prevailed in that
            settlement. It states that the "total number of Europeans who died in the Peninsula in 1818, was eight men, three women, and two children. We lost no civil, military or colonial officer,
            excepting one young Gentleman who died a month after his arrival, and is included in the number."</p>
         <p>A letter from the Havannah, dated 27th February, mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising in value, and that an agent from Messrs Baring is making purchases there to the
            amount of 1/3 a million sterling, in that single commodity.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from William Hunt, esq." To H. Hunt, esq.</p>
         <p>"Washington Hotel, New Orleans, Dec. 25. 1818.</p>
         <p>" My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month, after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health, and
            very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here, and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire ;
            and, in fact, from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river, about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on
            shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, corner of Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill
            deer, by night coming on, we lost our road ; and, differing in opinions, we separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at
            ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet, and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground, in spite of the
            remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe cold, and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands
            of wild swans, wild geese, wild ducks, woodcocks, snipes, and other wild fowl. If you were there, you would kill a waggon load in a day, as I know you have frequently killed a horse load
            in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them, and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself,
            Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passengers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon are sugar plantations, sugar-houses,
            &amp; c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter, as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of
            French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy, bad managers, and appear to use their negroes
            very cruel, and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer, as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week.
            The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines, and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath.
            Here is one Church, which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open, and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the
            evening, gambling &amp; c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the best in the city ; it is expensive, although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including claret and rum
            and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England, and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July, although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent
            Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the
            soil, and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage, and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half
            tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them
            carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him, so that we shall have some
            hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all
            over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me, but they may follow us ; as I understand the
            labourers, with the pay of a dollar a day, can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I have seen from Illinois,
            report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we
            shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts, cravats, pocket handkerchiefs, &amp; c. &amp; c. The price of a gallon of best rum
            is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes, yet,
            from what I have seen hitherto, I like America ten times better</p>

         <p>Emigration to America</p>
         <p>Important Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and respectable Engineer in Louisville, dated January 20. 1819.</p>
         <p>"The best time for coming to America I should judge to be in the summer, to land in September, so as to be able to get here before the weather was too cold. It is safe to settle in the
            beginning of winter or spring, so as to inure to the climate by degrees. The best plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage of a vessel, and find your own provisions; you will save
            more in this way, over a cabin passage, than would buy a decent farm here. The lands in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and one of corn alternately, and improve ; dung is never
            applied, and is said to be hurtful. It is without question what the land here is as good as can be, and when to this is added the heat of the summer, one ought to be able to raise crops as
            heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10 dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not cleared, all the trees under 12 inches are cut down and burned on the ground, and the large ones
            are killed by cutting round the bark. The ground is then prepared for Indian corn by scratching it with a hoe, or a kind of shuffle, which, from the looseness and mellowness of the soil,
            is easily done, and in this way sixty or eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised. – the trees die in a few months, and in three or four years fall down one by one, and the roots will
            rot out in seven or eight years. It is a great want of sense in any new settler not to adopt the modes of this country, proven to be the best adapted to the state of it by 200 years
            experience. The Americans, of all other people I know of, are the most ingenious in adapting the means to the end. I do not know if they have more sense than other nations, but they
            certainly make it go farther. Every tools answers the purpose most effectually. This is evident in their axes. An American will cut down three times more trees and square three times more
            timber than the best of your wrights could do, and not by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down four acres of wheat in a day, what what
            he calls a cradle scythe, and lay it as refular for binding as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian corn is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels of wheat is about the average of an
            acre. It is easier farming here than with you on sundry accounts ; the soil is free, few weeds make their appearance, and when ploughed down are certainly killed by the hot sun. There are
            no frosts to injure the crop, and no wet weather to destroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days, and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed the next. From the shortness and mildness
            of the winter, little provender is needed for the stock. Swine are raised at no expence. They breed and feed in the woods, and only want from one to three bushels of corn to fatten for
            killing, when they sell for five cents a lb. In the less settled parts of the country, it is the practise to give all the corn to swine and then send them to market. A bushel of corn is
            equal in nutriment to a bushel of wheat for man or beast.</p>

         <p>The brig Henry sailed from Cork on Wednesday se'ennight, with about two hundred passengers for Aux Cayes, to join Sir Gregor M'Gregor, who lately landed on the Spanish Main with a small
            force. General M'Gregor, it seems, left authority with Colonel Eyre to recruit men for his service, and to ship them as he best could. – There are a number of idle gentlemen about Dublin
            at present, and also many in the country, who have been captivated with the speculation of embarking in the Patriotic cause, and for some time they have appeared in the streets in fanciful
            uniforms. We understand that Col. Eyre has formed a Committee, who treat with such young gentlemen as have the inclination to proceed on the enterprise, and have money to pay for such rank
            as they may wish to possess under M'Gregor. The money thus furnished is made a stock purse to pay the freight of the vessel, and hence it is necessary that the greater part of the
            adventurers should be officers ; for those who are contented with the humble station of privates are not required to contribute and their passage, subsistence, &amp;c. must be defrayed by
            the common fund. Mr D'Evereaux, from the county of Wexford, is also raising men for the same service, but under different circumstances. He professes to have authority from General Bolivar
            to grant commissions, and to ship the men he may raise for head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men, and Col. Eyre has certainly shewn more activity in this
            respect. – Dublin Journal.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Advices have been received again from the Cape of Good Hope of 6th March, which are several days later than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the Caffres there remains no doubt,
            although it does not appear that Government have as yet received official information regarding it. The private accounts state that two valuable officers had lost their lives, and also a
            great number of men. The Governor himself in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caffres, had, with a competent force, proceeded to the interior. Great inconvenience was
            experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this been the case, it was believed that in a very few days tranquility would have been restored.</p>
         <p>We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January, and has done great mischief to the shipping, and also to the
            plantations of that ill-fated Island.</p>
         <p>A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th inst. At Batavia, two of the leaders of the late disturbances have been tried and execute, and that degree of tranquility which terror
            produces has been restored. In the administration of their colonies in the east, the conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ; and it is to be regretted that the
            extensive and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in possession of this country, various important improvements were
            introduced into its domestic administration ; the practise of torture, according to the humane and enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence, was abolished ; new and better modes of
            collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed, was evinced, which made the
            British Government highly popular.</p>
         <p>Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March, and had a great quantity of specie on
            board. No things have since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since her departure, and have arrived safe. The Ocean quitted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and arrived here several
            days since.</p>
         <p>Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thursday from Jamaica, bring Port Royal Papers to the 25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West
            India Regiment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be disbanded.</p>

         <p>Emigration.</p>
         <p>The increased population of this country, as well as the great difficult to which the middling classes of society are exposed in their efforts to procure the ordinary means of sustenance,
            has given rise to the formation of little copartnerships, or joint stock companies of individuals, who, being unable to command capital enough singly, to encounter the expences of a new
            settlement, have put their little funds together, with a determination to sail for America, and there jointly to labour for the general good of the whole, until fortune shall so far favour
            their efforts as to enable them to become independent of each other. By this means much less than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birkbeck as the proper stock for an emigrant to begin
            with, will be sufficient ; and thus a new impetus will be given to that tide of huma beings which is constantly flowing towards the new world. Would it not be policy to give encouragement
            to these industrious swarms to settle in our own colonies? We have heard with some pleasure in rumour that several parishes have taken into their serious consideration the prudence of
            establishing a fund for the encouragement of those poor persons who may be dispoed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; in furtherance of which laudable design, an application is to
            be made to Government for grants of land in desirable siutations, especially in Upper Canada, where the climate is described to be of the finest description. There is no doubt that many
            who are now pining in workhouses would gladly accept of such an alternative, and who, instead of being, as at present, a burthen to themselves and to society, would, by their exertions, be
            adding to the importance and stability of our possessions in that quarter, as well as opening a new source for the consumption of our manufactures.</p>

         <p>Letter from Mr Morris Birkbeck</p>
         <p>"English Prairie, (Illinoia,) Nov.25. 1818.</p>
         <p>" Sir – Your favour of 15th June is before me. Presuming you retain a copy of the queries, I proceed to answer then in order: – Respecting domestic servants ; what may be the condition of
            our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee, but should it be in your power to bring with you female domestics, it would be well to do so ; also a carpenter or two and a few
            labourers ; if with families, so much the better. Written engagements for a term, or indentures, are not binding, unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I have not seen any of these
            documents, and can therefore give you no precise directions for them : perhaps a simple engagement from the parties, acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred in bringing our, might be
            a sufficient security, leaving their wages to be determined here according to the current rates, yet to be established by the proportion of supply to the demand, which, as I remarked
            above, it is now impossible to ascertain. As to the number of labourers, or female domestics, you would need perhaps six of the former and two of the latter would a safe adventure, looking
            to the colony for an addition, should you need it, after you are settled – before that you will find a greater number an incumbrance : this is, I think, all I can say to your first, third,
            fourth, and fifth queries. All expence of transfer of your family and luggage, supposing the latter to weigh ten thousand pounds, I should estimate under L.1000 sterling. On this
            particular subject Mr R. Flower would give you most particular information – The luggage would cost about ten dollars per 100 lbs. So much for your query. To the seventh query – I think
            L.200 would assist your family in plenty for a year, exclusive of wages and clothing. Eighth query – L.3000 would be a good capital for a section, or 640 acres, and I question your wishing
            to hold in cultivation a larger tract. Ninth query – I consider our situation not liable to future disturbance from Indians, in the event of a war between Great Britain and the United
            States, being covered by increasing settlements to the west, north-west, and north. Tenth query – The earthquakes mentioned by Bradbury I have heard of from many persons ; but I have not
            discovered that it has left any impression on the public mind ; on this score, for my own part, I feel no anxiety about the matter ; Great Britain, I suppose, in proportion to its
            dimensions, is equally liable to earthquakes. Elenventh query, – The route by New Orleans will, I have no doubt, be preferable to that by the eastern cities. When due precaution against
            the diseases of the climate are observed, I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth query – The health of my family has not suffered from the climate. One of my sons has been affected
            with ague. This summer has been more sickly in these parts than any season for seven years past, and has afforded me a most encouraging confirmation of the temperature and salubrity of our
            settlement, and has also afforded immeasurable proofs of those facts regarding the sufferings of new settlers, to which I have so anxiously invited the attention of the readers of my
            journal. On the whole, provided common sense should be seconded by common industry, in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony, I think we shall not be visisted by more than our due
            share of physical calamity. I deferred noticing your second query, the subject being connected with the proposal respecting land, at the conclusion of your letter. I would strongly
            recommend your deferring the purchase of land until your arrival. It would be difficult to convey to you the reasons, but you would feel the propriety of my advice, should you come. I
            think you would have as good a choice two years hence as now, because excellent siutations, as yet unsurveyed, will then be on sale. I have no eligible offer to make you beyond a section.
            You inquire concerning venomous reptiles ; they are no source of injury or alarm to us. Insects, in new countries, often abound to an astonishing degree, and are sufficiently teazing to
            man and beast. Many species yield instantly to cultivation, and are heard of no more as plagues ; others will continue until conquered by order and industry. The thermometer ranges from 13
            below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are, of course, of rare occurence, and short duration. At Philadelphia, I understand, it rose this summer 97, and in this neighbourhood, in the low
            river bottoms, I believe it might reach that degree. On our praire I think it never reached 89. The smaller streams are rapid and soon dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme – catfish,
            perch, sturgeons abound, and many others I believe. I think 1000 dollars would build a comfortable plain dwelling. – Your obedient servant, M. Birkbeck."</p>

         <p>Intended Colony at the Cape of Good Hope</p>
         <p>The following letters explains, in detail, the degree of co-operation which Government proposes to afford to those persons who may wish to emigrate from this country. It will be read with
            peculiar interest, and it enables us to answer, in the most satisfactory manner, the many inquiries which have been addressed to us, upon the nature and extent of the plan of which the
            Chancellor of the Exchequer submitted an outline to Parliament just before its prorogation.</p>
         <p>( Official Circular.</p>
         <p>"Downing Street, London, 1819. I have to acquaint you in reply to your letter of the –, that the following are the conditions under which it is proposed to give encouragement to emigration
            to the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
         <p>The sufferings to which many individuals have been exposed, who have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign possessions, unconnected and unprovided with any capiral, or even the means of
            support, having been very afflicting to themselves, and equally burdensome to the colonies to which they have proceeded, the Government have determined to confine the application of the
            money recently voted by address in the House of Commons, to those persons, who possessing the means, will engage to carry out, at the least, ten able bodied individuals above 18 years of
            age, with or without families, the Government always reserving to itself the right of selecting from the several offers made to them those which may prove, upon examination, to be most
            eligible.</p>
         <p>In order to give some security to the Government, that the persons undertaking to make these establishments have the means of doing so, every person engaging to take out the above
            mentioned number of persons or families shall deposit at the rate of L.10 (to be repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every famly so taken out, provided that the family does not consist of
            more than one man, one woman, and two children under 14 years of age. All children above the number of two will have to be paid for, in addition to the deposit above mentioned, in the
            proportion of L.5 for every two children under 14 years of age and L.5 for every person between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
         <p>In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be provided at the expence of Government for the settlers, who shall also be victualled from the time of their embarkation until the time
            of their landing in the colony.</p>
         <p>A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter specified, be made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every such person or family whom he shall so take out ; one-third of the sum advanced
            to Government on the outset shall be repaid on landing, when the victualling at the expence</p>
         <p>of Government shall cease. A further proportion of onethird shall be repaid, as soon as it shall be certified to the Governor of the colony that the settlers under the direction of the
            person taking them out are actually located upon the land assigned to them ; and the remainer at the expiration of three months from the date of their location.</p>
         <p>If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy of population shall unite in selecting an intelligent individual to proceed to the Cape, with settlers under his direction, not less in
            number and of the description abovementioned, and shall advance money in the proportion above-mentioned, the Government will grant land to such an individual at the rate of 100 acres for
            every head of a family, leaving the parish at liberty to make such conditions with the individual, or the settlers, as may be calculated to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable
            with the maintenance of such settlers, in the event of their return to this country.</p>
         <p>But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless it shall be clear that the persons proposing to become settlers shall have distinctly given their consent, and the head of each family
            is not infirm or incapable of work.</p>
         <p>It is further proposed, that in any case in which one hundred families proceed together, and apply for leave to carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion, Government will,
            upon their being actually located, assign a salary to the minister who they have may have selected to accompany them, if he shall be approved by the Secretary of State.</p>
         <p>The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed, which rent, however, will be remitted for the first ten years ; and at the expiration of three years (during which the party and a
            number of families, in the proportion of one for every 100 acres, must have resided on the estate), the land shall be measured at the expence of Government, and the holder shall obtain,
            without fee, his title thereto, on a perpetual quit rent, not exceeding in any case L. 2 sterling for every 100 acres ; subject, however to this clause beyond the usual reservations"–that
            the land shall become forefited to Government, in case the party shall abandon the estate, or not bring it into cultivation within a given number of years. I am Your most obedient humble
            servant. * The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to make such roads as may be necessary for the convenience of the
            colony.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>A letter from Corfu, dated the 10th ult. states that the Governor of the Ionian Islands, General Maitland, embarked on the 8th inst. for Rome, in order to negotitate a Concordat relative
            to the Romish Clergy of the United Islands, as it appeared that Lord Guildford, who had been charged with the affair by the Prince Regent, had failed in his negotiation to that effect.</p>
         <p>Previously to the departure of the Governor, a deputation from the Parguinotes emigrants waited upon him, to claim the sum to be paid by Ali Pacha, for property left in Parga, agreeably to
            stipulation. General Maitland assured them he would not depart without adopting measures in their favour, and immediately issued a proclamation, appointing a commission of payment. Sir
            Frederick Adam fills the office of High Commissioner, ad interim, during the absence of the Governor.</p>
         <p>Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. The following is from the Guiana Chronicle of the 24th May:–" We observe by St Vincent: papers, which we have just received, that the
            Royal York Rangers, under the command of Colonel Smelt, had embarked on board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports for Canada, where the regiment is intended to be disbanded. It is stated
            that each of the men will have a certain portion of land allotted them in that province for cultivation and their future support.</p>
         <p>We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d ult by which we learn that in the Court of Session, on the 18th idem, Capt. Redman, of the brig San Domingo, from Ross, was ordered to pay a
            fine of 10l. each, for 20 passengers brought in that vessel over and above the number allowed by act of Parliament; and a further sum of 10l. for not having the regulations respecting
            passengers posted up in some conspicuous part of the vessel ; making in all a fine of 210l.</p>
         <p>We subjoin an extract from the Montreal Herald of the 12th June, relative to Mr Gourlay, the celebrated reformer:</p>
         <p>From the Niagara Spectator, of the 27th May, we find the far famed champion of civil liberty, Mr Gourlay, has again made his debut in an address to the resident landowners of Upper Canada.
            This production is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations, abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the superficial reader ;
            and some of the most egregious errors in colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dissent from the political proceeding of
            this reformer, it would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to enter into a refutation of the tenets, or an exposure of the absurdities, contained in his address. By others we might
            be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while, as men we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has deprived society of the benefits
            which might have been reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless has a share), we must, as good subjects, feel happy that his career has been checked without any bad
            consequences to society.</p>
         <p>The following is the present distribution of the forces in the West Indies:– 2d Regiment (or Queen's) –Demerara. 4th Ditto–Head-quarters, Grenada, five companies; Trinidad, three companies
            ; and Tobago, two companies. 5th Ditto–Head-quarters, Antigua, five companies ; St. Christopher's, four companies ; Montserrat, one company. 9th Ditto–Head-quarters, St Vincent's, five
            companies ; Dominica, three companies ; St Lucia, two companies. 21st Ditto (Fusileers)–Barbadoes. 1st West India Regiment–Head-quarters, Barbadoes, six companies ; St Lucia, one company ;
            Dominica, two companies ; Antigua, one company. 3rd Ditto–Head-quarters, Trinidad, five companies till further orders. In Jamaica are the 50th, 58th, 61st, and 92d regiment. In Honduras,
            five companies of the 2d West India regiment.</p>

            proportion of 5l. for every person between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
         <p>"In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be provided at the expence of Government for the settlers, who shall be victualled from the time of their embarkation until the time of

         <p>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to make such roads as may be necessary for the convenience of the Colony.</p>
         <p>There are already three extensive settlements on the South East Coast of Africa, where the finest wheat is produced, with little labour, namely Algoa Bay, St. Catherine's Bay, and the new
            settlement on the Knysua, a considerable river, which is navigable for large vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive and fertile lands towards Saldanha Bay. As the produce from
            the new colonists will consist of grain and as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of France, Brazils &amp;c. will in all probability be soon overstocked, the settlers will look
            to the mother country for a market, when an unfavourable harvest renders the import necessary ; and in anticipation of this event, the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend, we
            understand, to make an application to Government respecting the Corn Laws, to put the corn from the Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as grain from the British North American
            colonies.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>The accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of Good Hope are to the 17th April, which are considerably later than those previously received.</p>
         <p>Information has just reached Cape Town, that a detachment of troops, joined by a number of the inhabitants, who had been sent to suppress the Caffres, had succeeded in driving them back,
            and were compelled to cross the river. The corn districts were in a great measure cleared of the savages, and the country-people were returning to their homes, where they considered
            themselves secure from any further attacks, at least for some time to come.</p>
         <p>Letters have just been received, via Calcutta, from New South Walves, up to the end of November. The colony was then all well, and several convict-ships (the Marley, Glory, Mario,
            Isabella, and others) had arrived, having made the passage out direct in the short period of three months and twenty days, and landed all their convicts and passengers in good health. This
            may be considered as another, among many proofs, that it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate port.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Sierra Leone, dated January 9</p>
         <p>"It is with the deepest regret I inform you, that notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain, and the faith of treaties solemnly entered into, this coast swarms with slave vessels,
            drugging thousands of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here the Union, of Liverpool : the supercargo states, that during his stay in the River
            Calaba, not less than eight vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sailed for the Spanish Collective."</p>
         <p>" Montreal, May 11</p>
         <p>"We learn there are about 70 souls, mostly Canadians, preparing to set out from this place, the 25th inst. for Lord Selkirk's settlement on the River Rouge. The number of settlers there at
            this time, it is said amount to about 590. An intelligent Canadian, in easy circumstances with whom we conversed, and who goes thither with the before-mentioned settlers, with all his
            family, says he passed a winter there when engaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile country, and the climate much milder than that of Canada. Thus, there is every
            appearance, that this Colony, in the course of time, will become populous and flourishing."</p>

         <p>Fire at Newfoundland</p>
         <p>We are sorry to state that another most distressing and calamitous fire has taken place at St. John's Newfoundland. Captain Critchelly, of the alliance, arriv-[?] ed at Liverpool from
            Carbonear, in Newfoundland, [?] which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke out in an uninhabited house in St. John's between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 18th of
            June and that from the inflammable nature of the house[?] and more particularly of their roofs, it spread with such rapidity, that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-[?] milies were
            burnt out, besides an immense quantity of produce consumed in various stores and warehouses.</p>
         <p>We learn from another account, that the fire destroyed the whole of the old part of the town. It broke out near Conder and Tracy's store, and burnt all between that and Messrs Baine,
            Johnson and Co.'s.</p>
         <p>Cape of Good Hope</p>
         <p>At the present moment, under the prospect of emigration, all intelligence coming from this quarter is of peculiar interest. The letters which reached town [?] Tuesday, mention that the
            Caffres had commenced [?] tilities anew, and that their numbers were very considerable.</p>
         <p>Cape Town, May 5. The Caffres have broken out, and a very serious war is carried on at present on the borders. It is said that the savages are to the amount of 50,000, and a detachment of
            6000 attacked Graham's Town on Saturday week, about 12 o'clock in the day, but were repulsed, and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every
            district of the colony for the young boors to inrol themselves to oppose the enemy.</p>
         <p>Cape Town, May 16. The 13th regiment, commanded by Colonel Wilshire have come up with the main body of Caffres, near Graham's Town and have defeated them with great loss. Since then they
            have withdrawn from the British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?] place a few days ago from England and have since[?] marched off for the frontiers. A large number of infantry
            have been mounted on horseback to [?] them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present Governor is going home, and that
            another has been appointed.</p>
         <p>Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us, which confirms the sad accounts of the miserable fate of the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor. It appears that the schooner Marsha[?]
            had brought accounts from San Blas[?], that M'Gregor, after his disgraceful flight from Porto Bello, proceeded[?] in the brig Hero, for St. Andreas, where he arrived on the 7th of May, and
            left on the 12th, having suffered considerably from the effects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had been betrayed by some of his Officers, who had [?] Porto Bello ; but added
            he would soon receive reinforcements from England, when he would retake it.</p>
         <p>The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South American station, last from Rio Janeiro, whence she sailed on the 8th of June. She landed about two millions of dollars at Rio Janeiro, from
            Litna[?] and brought to England about 140,000 on merchants' account. She, and the Andromache, Captain Shirreff, having [?] treasure on board, passed Lord Cochrane's squadron, in the South
            Seas, but his Lordship did not discover even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the ships. His Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent order ; and it is but justice to his
            Lordship to state, that he has not resorted to any undue or improper means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every instance of complaint made to him by the masters of merchant
            shipping, of any of their crew having deserted to him, he ordered the men to be again instantly sent on board their respective ships.</p>

         <p>Emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. (From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.)</p>
         <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to Parliament the expediency of voting t50,000 towards the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. Let it be remembered, once
            for all, that it is not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants, but that the mother country is too full, that this plan is suggested. The question is not how you maintain a surplus
            peasantry in the land that gave them birth, but, whether you will stop emigration to the frozen shores of Canada, and to the United States, or divert and encourage it to the finest colony
            in the world – We surely have learnt enough of North America to convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of its people. South African, on the other hand, has every advantage to
            repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of our forefathers.</p>
         <p>The more fully to understand and appreciate these advantages, we shall set before our readers a short view of the conditions and facilities of the colony in question.</p>
         <p>The spring, from September to December, is the most agreedable season. The summer, from December to March, is often intensely hot. The autumn, from March to June, is generally fine and
            pleasant. The winter is rainy and stormy, and for the most part so cold as to make fires very comfortable during the months of July, August, and September. Most of the diseases that appear
            among the natives proceed rather from their gross and indolent modes of living, than the unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and
            for want of industry or materials this defect is not remedied, as it is in India, by artificial tanks or reservoirs. Whenever, however, irrigation can be employed, either from wells or
            rivers, the most abundant vegetation ensues. Good and abundant water has always been found by digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the whole colony there is scarcely a river
            that can be called navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the winter, most of them dry up during the summer. All the rivers are well stocked with perch, eels and small turtle ; and
            with a certain distance from the coast they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas.</p>
         <p>There is general want of wood in South Africa – At the distance, however, of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some of these trees (taxus
            elongatus) grow to the amazing size of 10 feet in diameter, and to the height of 30 or 40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is useful for many purposes, but will not bear exposure
            to weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree...</p>
         <p>The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe, and to what perfection the other wines of the colony are capable of being brought, may very fairly be augured for the great improvement that
            has already taken place in its manufacture. Heretofore, the Dutch farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quantity than the quality of their wine. And when a cargo was once shipped,
            it mattered little to them, whether sound or sour it reached its destination. Little care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while
            decayed and unripe grapes, stalks and leaves, were all promiscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode also of seasoning the casks with brimstone, and the want of good brandy to fit it
            for foreign markets, have all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons have
            been sent out from Madeira and this country, and every care seems now taken to meet and secure the growing demand in European markets. The trifling duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this
            country, has been the means of introducing it into many families, which have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances on this
            preference, it surely is but equitable that encouragement should be given to the stape export of a colony, now decidely, and we must trust unalterably, English. But in addition to wines
            there are other articles of colonial growth, exported to the East Indies, Europe, and America. Grain, wool, bides, and skins, whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap and
            candles, aloes, tobacco. Such are the articles of commerce that might be turned to the best account. – But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will continue to thrive in this colony,
            under the present mode of administering its government and laws. It has been said, that despotism would be the best of governments were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but contituted as
            human nature is, we fear that the purest amongst us needs some control. Control, however, there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a
            proclamation in the Cape Gazette, and from that moment his fiat becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an adviser in the colonial secretary, whose influence does not extend beyond that
            of mere advice. Strange to add, the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch laws, rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the different governors of the colony. All pleadings are in
            writing, and were, till laterly, carried on, foribus clausis. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and civil cases was established, over both of which the governor presides. In India, in
            the West Indies, and in Canada, there is a governor and a council. These act as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is no appeal beyond the governor.</p>
         <p>The taxes, however, at the Cape, under which we groan so painfully in this country, are comparatively trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy import duty, but their purchase is
            matter of choice.– This falls not upon the poor, not consequently will it fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the provisions of the Parliamentary grant.</p>
         <p>Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and precautions, than the encouragement bedd out in Mr Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit, L. 10. is to be made at the colonial office in
            Downing Street, by each individual. A free passage is to be granted, and on reaching the Cape, this deposit is to be returned to the settler by the local government. And such is the
            liberality that has guided the proposed plans, it is moreover stipulated, that if 100 families should agree to emigrate, and their minister with them, not only permission will be granted
            them so to do, but provision will be made for him. The separation from country and from kindred is thus softened, and it will allay many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that in
            distant lands, and amongst a strange people, the settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a pastor, to whom custom, veneration, and affection, have all united to attach
            him.</p>
         <p>It appears that the experiment of a settlement of English, has already been made upon a limited plan at Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : and with such success as to give
            the best encouragement to a more extensive emigration. Indeed, from what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great facilities, we have no doubt whatever of the benefits that must
            arise to the sober, steady exertions of the industrious. At the Cape, or elsewhere, poverty and misery will attend the vicious and indolent, but certain we are, that there is no country
            under heaven, where the poor may find a safer asylum, and where activity, economy and good conduct, will meet with so certain and full a reward.</p>
         <p>During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a Scotch regiment) at the Cape, many of the privates were known to save the whole of their pay, and were thus enabled to return to England
            with a very hand some little fortune. English servants of all descriptions are in great request, and 1.5 sterling a month are no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is nevertheless to
            beremember, that clothes of all kinds are expensive at the Cape, as no manufactory is permitted, lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still farmers in the country dress very
            coarsely and cheaply ; and their wives and daughters, except on Sunday, are humbly clad as themselves. Indeed, in so soft a climate as the Cape, there is that occasion for multiplicity and
            warmth of apparel which colder regions require. For three-fourths of the year, the best bed is a hard mattress with a single coverlet.</p>
         <p>There is point which we cannot pass over ; as we think it very intimately connected with the virtue and happiness of the settlers. And that is, the education of their children. Nothing is
            more neglected than this in Southern Africa. The boors, (farmers) are ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the minister that is to accompany 100 families, it would be highly
            expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to introduce into the colony the Madras system of instruction, and a free school upon that
            plan has been established at Cape Town, with considerable success. Still the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all the
            necessaries of human life, and beyond this they have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has its fruits, ignorance has its weeds. The savage and unparalleled cruelties that have
            heretofore been exercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want of education, as a main cause. The unjust limits shown by
            the Dutch laws to the white man's barbarities have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen, and, therefore, too much care cannot be taken to
            guard the families of the new settlers against the contagion of the inhumanities that they must see practised around them, and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with our duty to
            God and man will counteract this influence aided a knowledge of common school attainments, we need not say. The</p>
         <p>We have thrown these remarks together more as loose hints for the consideration of our readers, than with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide and important a subject. We may
            be induced hereafter to review the question more in detail. The plan itself, as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer, has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Americe we have
            not seen, and can only speak from the reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently discouraging. On the contrary, all who have seen and described the Cape, have united in praising it.
            Food is cheap and abundant, the price of labour is exceedingly high, trade is important and increasing, many parts of the colony are beautiful, and its climate is mild and healthy. There
            are few countries upon earth where so many components of happiness will be found to concentrate.</p>

         <p>Emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. ( Official Circular.)</p>
         <p>The following circular has been addressed to the parties whose lists of the individuals engaged to proceed with them as settlers to the Cape of Good Hope have been approved of by the
            Colonial Department: –</p>
         <p>Downing Street, London, 30th Sept. 1819.</p>
         <p>Sir – I am directed by Earl Batburst to acquaint you, that he has under consideration your letter of, and that he accepts the proposal which you have mde, to take a party of able bodied
            settlers, with their families, to the Cape of Good Hope, where a grant of land will accordingly be assigned to you on your arrival, in conformity with the regulations laid down by his
            Majesty's Government.</p>
         <p>I have therefore to request, that you will immediately transmit to me three separate lists of the individuals who have placed themselves under your direction, and I inclose to you proper
            returns for that purpose ; at the same time, I deem it necessary to mention, that it is absolutely requisite that the details respecting the individuals of your party which you are called
            upon to state in your returns should be correctly specified, as any erroneous statement upon these heads, but more particularly in respect of the age of the individuals, could not fail to
            be productive of much inconvenience. Upon receiving there returns, I shall lose no time in stating to you the amount of the money which you will be required to deposit under the existing
            regulations, and the mode in which the payment is to be made.</p>
         <p>I am, Sir, your most obedient servant,</p>
         <p>(Signed) Henry Goulburn.</p>
         <p>P.S. – If there be any Officers on the half pay of the army or navy, or military of naval pensioners among the individuals proceeding under your direction, it will be necessary that you
            should transmit to me a (fourth) list, specifying their usual place of residence, and the designation under which they are respectively known at the War Office, and at the Admiralty, in
            order that I may take the necessary measures to enable them to receive their allowances in the colony.</p>
         <p>These persons should, on their part, immediately apply to the Secretary at War, and to the Secretary of the Admiralty, stating their intention to emigrate to the Cape of Good Hope, and
            requesting instructions for their guidance in respect to the receipt of their allowances.</p>
         <p>In making your arrangements for embarkation, it will be necessary that you should bear in mind, that you will be allowed tonnage for the conveyance of the baggage of your party, at the
            rate of one ton (measurement 40 cubic feet) for each single able bodied individual, and two tons for each able bodied individual who is accompanied by his family.</p>
         <p>The above circular is accompanied by a form of the required return ; the several heads of which are distinguished in separate columns, as follows:</p>
         <p>Return of settlers proceeding to the Cape of Good Hope, under the direction of – Names of the men – their age – profession or trade. Names of the women – their age. Names of the male
            children – their age. Names of the female children – their age. Deposit money payable by the respective settler.</p>

            that General Bolivar, who had been joined by one of Murillo's Generals, with a number of troops, was making rapid advances towards Santa Fe with upwards of 5000 men ; and it was expected
            the next courier would announce[?] the fall of that place. An Aide-deCamp of the Governor of that place arrived at Carthagena at midnight with the above information. Another account
            states, that the Venezuelian army, under General Bolivar in person, had obtained possession of Santa Fe, and that his advanced guard was at Honda[?] ; he had succeeded in cutting off the
            retreat of General Samana[?], the Captain-General of Santa Fe ; his Secretary, Ramirez, has arrived at Carthagena with the above intelligence ; it was also added that a part of Bolivar's

            incidentally, that the scarcity which lately prevailed at the Cape has entirely ceased ; ample supplies of wheat and flour having lately been imported or brought to market.</p>

         <p>Friday, a Court Martial was assembled on board the Queen Charlotte, in Portsmouth harbour, and continued by adjournment during Saturday, to inquire into the circumstances of the supposed
            concealment of two deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot on board his Majesty's ships Phaeton[?], Captain W. H. Dillon, in the month of October last, when that ship was
            about to proceed to the East Indies; and to try Lieutenant John Geary, the first Lieutenant of the said ship, for his conduct upon that occasion. The Court[?] was crowded with officers,
            &amp;c. from the shore each day. The prosecution was closed on Saturday afternnoon, and the Court adjourned till ten o'clock on Monday, when Lieutenant Geary made his defence. The Court
            having considered the whole of the evidence, were of opinion that the charge was proved, and sentenced him to be dismissed his Majesty's ship Phaeton, and severely reprimanded.</p>
         <p>Letters from Port Jackson, New South Wales, dated March 30th, were receivedon Sunday. The ships Surrey and Lord Sidmouth, with convicts from England, arrived on the 4th and 11th March. A

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Spanish Town, Jamaica –August 31.</p>
         <p>The mail will convey to you sufficiently afflicting news of the voyages which the fever is committing amongst us. Part of the 92nd and 50th have made their escape on board the Serapis 64,
            which has been roofed to, and most handsomely and humanely given up by the Admiral for the use of the troops. The loss in men stands about thus: 59th[?], 200[?] ; 92d, 120. The 58th and
            81st are scattered[?] ; but from all I can learn, their loss is not great. The following is a list of the officers and their relatives who have fallen victims in the course of this month :
            –</p>
         <p>Lieut.-Colonel Sparrow, Deputy Adjt.-General. Lieut.-Colonel [?], 52d regiment. Lieut.-Colonel Hill th[?] regiment. Major Rowe, 50th regiment, son-in-law of Paymaster Montgomery, of the
            50th. Mrs Rowe, wife of Major Rowe, whom she survived but a few hours, and daughter of Paymaster Montgomery. Major Montgomery, 50th, son of Paymaster Montgomery. Mrs Montgomery, wife of
            ditto. Assistant Surgeon Brown, 50th, son in-law of do. Lieut. Richardson, 50th. Lieut. North[?], 50th. Lieut. and Adjutant Lyon, 50th. Two Misses Lyon, daughter of Adjutant Lyon. Lieuts.
            R. M'Donald and George Mackie, 92d. Ensign [?] [?]th Doctor [?], Medical Staff. Captain and Paymaster Turner, 58th. The Misses Baxter, daughters of Quarter-Master Baxter[?].</p>
         <p>The scenes that have occurred during this awful mortality have been most distressing. It has not been confined to the military, for the inhabitants have even out numbered them.</p>
         <p>The Quebec Mercury of the [?] gives long extracts from the American papers, respecting the [?] of a large tract of country by the [?] Indians, to the British Government, 2,748,000 acres,
            stretching from the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower part of the province, in the rear of the old settlements on the Ottawa, and not in any manner coming into
            contact with or approach within many miles of the boundary of Louisiana. Yet, upon the supposition that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian territory, the American Papers are loud
            in their invectives against this country.</p>
         <p>Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?], dated the 28th September, which mention, that the plague which had been for some time in the vicinity, had at length broken out in that town.
            We are happy to add however, that the deaths at that period were only three or four each day, and it was then confined to the Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen victims
            to the pestilence. The weather being extremely cold, great hopes were entertained that the further progress of the disease would speedily be put a stop to when trade, which then at a
            stand, would renew its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Mogadoru is between 10 and 12,000 persons ; by far the greater part of whom consider it contrary to their religious
            tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking the infection ; and, in the event of their having it would not, for the same reason, have recourse to any means to counteract it.</p>

         <p>Emigration to America</p>
         <p>[ From the Observer. ]</p>
         <p>The following letter from a lady who emigrated to America, from within four miles of Godalming, in Surrey, two years back, has been handed to us for insertion. During the present rage for
            emigration, we think we are justified in giving it insertion, leaving it to those who are interested in its contents to draw their own con clusions. We have reason to conclude that the
            letter is genuine, and is not, we believe, as many have been which have found their way into the public press, the produce of ingenuity on this side the Atlantic: –</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, July 29. 1818</p>
         <p>"My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter, together with the patterns you were kind enough to forward Although our habits here are in many respects different from those on your
            side of the Atlantic, yet, I assure, there is a considerable degree of anxiety among our American belles for English fasions ; and the display which your prompt attention to my request has
            enabled me to make, has procured me not alone a great influx of visitors, but of business. You ask me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing hither with your wife and
            family. I can have no hesitation in complying with this request ; but, at the same time, I shrink from the responsibility of your being persuade, from any things which I may say, to follow
            my example. It is impossible to disguise from myself, and I would not attempt to disguise it from you, that many who have come here, anticipating prosperity and independence, have failed ;
            but, at the same time, as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge, I am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result of unpardonable imprudence, and the absence
            of that activity and spirit of perseverance, by which persons depending on their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen many individuals here reduced to very melancholy
            straits from having left their native shores thoughtlessly, without more money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. This has been dissipated, on their landing, almost
            before they had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and being thus reduced to extremity, their spirits have failed, and they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and
            listless despair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades to follow, and will sumbit to degradation, as some of them call it, of becoming journeymen, do tolerably well.</p>
         <p>"With regards to myself, I need not recall to your mind the species of drudgery to which I was forced to submit, in order to support a decent appearance in London. You often joked me on my
            enterprising disposition, and doubted my resolution to come to this country in search of that independence which I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am, however, and an hour
            since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work women, the lowest of whose weekly wages, I those who take their work home, is five dollars! You will start at this and so will Mrs B. It is,
            however, no less true than extraordinary. In short I have every reason to be grateful to Providence for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment which has turned
            out so fortunately. I have commenced both millinery and dress-making, to which I have added the childbed and ready made linen business ; and in every one of branches I am full of orders.
            My most sanguine hopes have been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly 1.60 Sterling and a few of those articles of stock which were necessary to make a show. These, combined
            with the attractive titled of " Miss P–, from London,'&amp;c. in a few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did my utmost to please my customers, and, in a few months, moved from
            a situation of obscurity to one of the first respectability. I am thus particular because I know you feel an interest in my fate. My brother James, who you know is a bricklayer and
            builder, has been equally fortunate.– He has had several contracts, and is now building a row of twenty houses, besides other jobs of a smaller description.</p>
         <p>"Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from Godalmbing and its neighbourhood I am proud to say they have all been tolerably successful. The greater part of them, you know, were
            farmers, and they are now settled in farms of from fifty to five hundred acres, from one hundred to one thousand miles from this place. All these, hoever, came out with small capitals–but
            none with less than myself–and husbanding their resources, and abstaining from extravagance of every description, they finally successed in laying the foundation of their own future
            happiness.</p>
         <p>We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; but this must wear off in the course of time?other there is a roughness and absence of what we call "good manners" about some
            of the Americans, not at all congenial to English taste. They are for the most part, however, hospitable ; and if you let them have their way, and do not thwart their humours, are really
            very kind, and disposed to friendly intercourse. You talk to carrying your family to the Western states–to the Illinois country, and of commencing farmer and storekeeping there. It is
            probably that your views may be very correct, but I think you may settle nearer to us, if not at so cheap a rate, at best with a greater certainty of present comfort. Of the Western
            States, I, of course, can know nothing but by report. The emigration in that direction has been immense, but the journey to some has been so long, as frequently to produce repentance
            before the destined goal was reached. We have had several English, Scotch, and Irish families here, on the way to Pittsburgh, who, I understand, were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ;
            but I have not heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the Ohio in arks, which you say you have seen described in Birkbeck's books. No doubt these people must have to
            encounter great privations, and perhaps some danger ; time and perseverance, however,will overcome all difficulties, and from the natural course of things, in the end the great object in
            view, plenty and independence, must be attained ; and this as you very justly say, is "worth a struggle." Upon the whole, if you can be content to give up all those luxuries of which an
            English fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits of social intercourse to which an English neighbourhood give encouragement ; and to derive happiness from the consciousness of seeing
            yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you, that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalanced by the
            castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these, at least you will be free here ; and as for society, your own family, large as it is, must be a treasure in itself ; added to which, in
            proportion as wealth increases, civilisation must follow. If you could get three or four families with whom you are acquainted, to join in your plans and settle in your neighbourhood, an
            additional assuance of success and happiness would be attained.</p>
         <p>"As to capital, I think you ought to hav, on your landing here, L. 500, which, with moderate exertions and common good fortune, must afford yo uthe means of certain prosperity. I shall,
            however, write again in September on this subject, when I intend sending for my sister, and perhaps the information I may be able to collect in the interim will confirm your plans, and
            induce you to accompany her to this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have another cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every particular in my next, as well as send you
            a list of the things, which it will be policy for you to bring with you. Your seven children, instead of being a burden to you here, will form one of the most prominent sources of your
            wealth."</p>

         <p>Emigration to Canada.</p>
         <p>About ten days ago an emigrant arrived from Canada, to Paisley, and brings very favourable intelligence from that country. He is a native of Scotland ; was some time in the army ; and is
            going home again, as he calls it, early in the spring. This person gives the most satisfactory and cheering account of the place, and says his chief complaint was the want of society to
            share in his felicities, to be companion of his joys, and to exult in his abundance. He adds that one of his principal reasons for coming here at present was hearing of our distressed
            condition, and that he might be able to persuade others to follow his example ; anxious to be surrounded by happy, intelligent, and social neighbours. His arrival and narrations, combined
            with other circumstances, have been the subject of considerable discussion the whole of last week. A strong desire for emigration has been manifested, and about 300 have already subscribed
            their names, as a testimony of their ardour to go away. A petition is immediately to be forwarded to his Majesty's Ministers, imploring their assistance by way of loan or donation, to
            enable them to carry their wishes into execution. This petition, it is said, is to be supported by the principal gentlemen of the county, and the utmost anxiety will doubtless prevail
            concerning its success. – Let us hope that Government will see the necessity of attending to the supplications of these people. The Sheriff Depute has been memorialized upon the subject,
            to give his counsel and support in behalf of the measure, and it is much to his honour that he has evinced a great disposition to favour the object in view. His office has been appointed
            for the reception of signatures, where the persons experience the greatest kindness in every possible way. It is proper, at the same time, to mention, that a number who were wishing to
            subscribe as desirous to emigrate, have been rejected ; as their circumstances were not of that despairing nature as to warrant an interposition of this kind in their favour. It cannot be
            expected that those who enjoy a considerable degree of comfort at home, or who have sufficient means of their own to emigrate without public aid, ought to be included among that number
            destined to participate in this salutary and benevolent proposition. Some of the fiercer radicals, with their accustomed zeal and spleen, are busily employed in jeering and deprecating the
            idea of emigration and telling the " people to stay and help" in the recovery of their rights. They declare the whole scheme to be a mere farce, intended to be played against them, in
            order to destroy the unanimity which they say exists in the nation concerning their grand object. These querulous politicians complain of the climate of Canada, and it must be granted that
            it resembles Italy more than Scotland, being hotter in summer and coller in winter than our own island but the country is healthy, the soil is fruitful and strong constitutions and
            longevity are as common there as in any other part of the globe. The same manners, language, and regulations prevail in Upper Canada as in Scotland, and when people have plenty of
            provisions, fuel and warm clothing to resist the effects of heavy snows and intense frosts, the objection of cold is less worthy of consideration. – Glasgow Chronicle.</p>

         <p>Dutch Colonial Law, and Negro Fortitude.</p>
         <p>(From Lavaysse's Account of Venezuela, Trinidad, Margaritta, and Tobago, just published.)</p>
         <p>Stedman, after having given a picture of the cruelties practised on the negroes at Surinam, relates that on his arrival in that colony, a white man was flagged by a black executioner, for
            having stolen some money from the townhouse ; and he remarked that this negro inflicted the punishment with great signs of commiseration. A negro was broken on the wheel for the same
            crime, and he bore that horrible punishment without a sigh. A moment afterwards, they prepared to hang another, and whilst the hangman was tying the cord round his neck to launch him into
            eternity, he looked steadfastly, with a smile of contempt, at his judges, who were among the spectators of the execution. " Having expressed to the persons who were near me, (says Captain
            Stedman) how much I was shocked with the injustice and cruelty of those executions, and surprised at the intrepidity of the negroes during the punishment, a very decent looking man thus
            addressed me ; Sir, you are newly arrived from Europe ; but if you were better acquainted with negro slaves, what you now see would neither excite your surprise nor your pity. It is not
            long since I saw a negro suspended from that very gibbet by the ribs. The following is the manner in which it was done : two incisions were made in his side, in which was passed an iron
            hook attached to a chain. He lived three days suspended in that manner, his head and feet hanging down, licking from his bleeding breast the drops of water that fell on it, for it rained
            at the time. The sufferer did not, however, utter a groan, and never once complained. On the third day, another negro was flogged under the gallows, and having cried from pain, the former
            reproached him for his want of courage: " Are you a man?" said he to him, " you behave like a child!" – A moment afterwards the soldier who was sentry on the spot taking pity on him,
            dashed out his brains with the butt end of his musquet. " I saw another negro quartered," the narrator: " After his arms and legs were tied to four very strong horses, an iron nail was
            driven under each nail of his hands and feet He suffered that without complaining, requested a glass of ru,, and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses. But that which amused us
            most," continued this monster, "was the humour of the fellow, who, when the hangman presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for, told him to drink first, as he was very much
            afraid of bepoisoned, and desired him to take care that his horses should not kick him. As for old negroes being broken on the wheel, and young women burnt alive, nothing is more common in
            this colony!"</p>

         <p>Mr Birkbeck's Settlement</p>
         <p>A small pamphlet has lately been published, consisting of letters and extracts of letters from Mr Birkbeck, of which we have been procured a copy. The author's object appears chiefly to
            have been to counteract the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement by Cobbett. We read Cobbett's remarks when they were first transmitted to this country, and
            certainly did not think them worthy of the notice here bestowed upon them. His objections to the new settlement, helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction, were of very
            little weight, except in so far as they applied to all emigration whatever ; and they had really nothing to render them worth reading, but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied
            them. We should, therefore, have been better pleased had Mr Birkbeck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire of his own endless contradiction, and rather given us some
            more details regarding the settlement. The Americans are every year pushing forward into the wilderness ; but it is a new thing for a body of our countrymen, when withdrawing from a
            society richly provided with all the accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the New World and to retire to the
            untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea Though the activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes and even luxuries of life to this remote place, still the settlers must find
            such a difference in their situation as must subject them to go many privations ; and some details, shewing how the colonists got over their difficulties, how their various wants were
            supplied, and how the feelings and habits of civilized life accommodated themselves to the woods and the wilderness, would have been much more interesting than a reply to Cobbett's
            captious objections. One of the most trying privations of the colony seems to be a want of wives, an evil which happily does not affect the mother country, amidst all her other sufferings.
            The evil has probably been aggravated by some of the colonists forgetting to take their wives with them. If matters don't get better in this particular, we may expect to hear of some of
            the adjoining American towns suffering a Sabine spoliation. A cargo of young ladies would evidently be one of the best mercantile speculations ; and as our own city had surplus of ten or
            twelve thousand females at the last census, we have no doubt that some of our enterprising export traders will take the hint, and, by scouring the boarding-schools, complete a choice
            assortment, adapted to the Illinois market.</p>
         <p>The following extracts the only parts that appear to have any general interest.</p>
         <p>" English Prairie, July 13. 1819. "My Friends and Countrymen,–For your service I exhibited, in two publications, an outline of the process of emigration, from its commencement up to the
            final settlement.</p>
         <p>"My first opinion of this, the spot of our choice, and the reasoning on which that choice was grounded, are before you ; and sufficient time has elapsed to try those opinnions by the test
            of experience, by which they are confirmed in every important particular. I showed you my own tract through the gloomy forest into a delightful country, better prepared for an abode by the
            hand of nature than the heavy woods by half a century of labour. I built me a cabin, and "belayed a road to it;" for it was my ambition to be surrounded by my old friends and neighbours.
            In this, too, I am gratified ; and we are contented with out allotment, both as to our present state and future prospects.</p>
         <p>"This small district, which two years ago was nearly without inhabitants, contains a thriving population of from six to seven hundred persons. We have been blessed with health most unusual
            for a new settlement, or for any settlement of equal numbers in any country ; and no doubt is entertained by us, or by any judicious observer, of its salubrity. We have several wells of
            excellent water, and many more are in progress. Our soil is fertile beyond my own expectation ; but our exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent objects of building
            and fencing, of which much has already been done. We have, however, collected a stock of hogs and cattle ; and I think acres of corn are now growing than there are individuals in the
            settlement."</p>
         <p>"With regard to pecuniary success, the capitalist is commencing his operations, or looking around him undecided as to the course he shall pursue ; but the labourer has made an
            establishment. It is not with him as with the capitalist, a state of hope merely, from good prospects, but of enjoyment, from good possessions. Numbers of this class, and of mechanics,
            have already realized their little freeholds, and are building cabins for themselves. The fruits of their labour are not squandered in dissipation and excess, because they have highr
            objects ; and, considering their former depressed condition, it is astonishing to me, as it is honourable to them, that they betry no arrogance in their to independence."</p>
         <p>"In the statements I have published, I see little to correct, as far as my observation and experience have now proceeded, excepting that, in my view of the profits of cultivation to early
            settlers, I have not made sufficient allowance in time for the innumerable delays and disappointments inseparable from new undertakings in a new country. A year of preparatory and
            unproductive exertion should be added to the debtor-side of the account at the outset."</p>

         <p>Proceedings of the Court</p>
         <p>Lord Provost Manderston having been called to the Chair, the Clerk, Mr A. Boswell, read a very distinct report of the results and general features of the transactions at the Infirmary and
            Queensberry House Hospital for the last year. The Lord Provost then named a Committee to examine the Treasurer's accounts, &amp;c., and report to the adjourned meeting to be held in
            February next.</p>
         <p>Mr John Witham junior then rose, and requested leave to submit a few observations to the consideration of the Court. He stated in substance that, though aware of its not being usual to
            vote thanks to the Managers until their accounts have been examined, he was yet anxious to embrace the first opportunity of expressing his conviction that the exertions of the Managers
            had, at last, placed this valuable Institution on a most desirable footing. Although he had not visited the Hospital for the last twelve months, he had not ceased to take an interest in
            its welfare ; and it was with great pleasure that he now stated, that whether his inquiries were made of the medical attendants, or of recent patients, the answers were uniformly
            satisfactory. The Hospital was favoured with a good Matron, between whom and the medical gentlemen the best understanding existed ; and the various salutary regulations of the Managers
            have led to such a prosperous state of things, as justly to entitle them to the gratitude of this Court and the public. Still, however, he must say, that although the Hospital was in a
            good state, yet, in his mind, Visitors could not fall to afford that assistance to the Managers here, and that security against internal abuses, which they had done in so many other
            similar institutions. It was difficult to account for the prejudices which existed against this species of assistance in Edinburgh. At Leeds, in addition, to visitors of our sex, there was
            a committee of ladies, who visisted the female wards, and from the joint labours of both classes of visitors many and great advantages had resulted. But in this city we had hospitals for
            females, which are governed by men only, without seeking any help from visitors of that sex, who are much better qualified to discharge most of the duties. This view of these matters, he
            trusted, would yet be attended to.–He must also crave the attention of the meeting to another matter, that of the L.11,700, for which the city of Edinburgh pays only 4 1/2 per cent. He
            assured the Court, and its Honoured Chairman, that this subject was not introduced with the view of touching upon, or insinuating any thing respecting the city's affairs. The money, he
            understood, was secured on the ale duty ; but why should the Hospital lose one-half per cent, of interest? He had once made a calculation, according to which the loss, from the beginning,
            had amounted to about L.10,000. It had been stated that the Magistrates of Edinburgh had always been friendly to the Hospital ; but that was surely no reason for withholding L.59 of
            interest that whatever former Magistrates had thought on the subject the present would not submit to the idea of depriving the Hospital of any part of its lawful interest. If the ground on
            which the Hospital was built was alluded to, it was plain that town had already got more, by the reduced interest than its original value. The town of Edinburgh had also got L.8273 ; 17 ;
            3 of invalid money from Government, on condition of paying the interest to the Infirmary, which inte- rest, if paid at two terms in the years, should be restricted to 3 1/2 per cent. And
            as the property tax–which the Town did not retain from the Hospital, whether they did or did not pay it to Government,–is now at an end, he could see no reason for withholding the usual
            rate of interest. He concluded by suggesting the names of several gentlemen as a Committee, to lend out the sum of L.11,700 on interest at 5 per cent, if the Magistrates of Edinburgh
            should decline to pay that rate of interest.</p>
         <p>Mr Alex. Cruishank seconded the motion</p>
         <p>Col. Crichton regretted that the respectable gentlemen should have introduced such a motion. He seldom visisted the Infirmary, but when he sent patients to it ; but he could state, that
            when his servants or workmen have been there from fever, the attention they received was in every respect equal to what he, and he hoped he was a respectable citizen, could command in his
            own house. But he could mention the testimony of one whose authority was much higher than his own – that of a medical gentlemen of some eminence in his profession, who lives abroad, and
            who was recently in this country. That professional gentleman spoke the very highest terms both of the medical treatment and the economy of the House. It was matter of pride, he said, to
            every Scotsman, to hear the manner in which the Infirmary of Edinburgh was spoke of in all the quarters of the globe. It was the pattern of all that was excellent in such institutions, and
            a nursery of the most skilfull practitioners ; for go where we will, the answer to almost every question put with respect to improved hospital treatment is, that it was learned in the
            Infirmary of Edinburgh. Whether, indeed, we thought of these things ; whether we looked at the sublime inscriptions on the outside of the Hospital, and the Christain doctrines and
            principles there inculcated or the treatement and management within we could not fail to be struck with admiration and without imputing any motives, which he was not entitled to do he must
            say, it would be much more creditable to the respectable gentlemen if they should confine themselves to expressing their high opinion of the institution and tanking the Managers instead of
            occupying the valuable time of this Honourable Court with quibbling about trifles, which were every way contemptible. After a pause, Col. Crichton made a counter motion, to get rid of Mr
            Wigham's.</p>
         <p>Lord Meadowbank reminded the Court, that this matter of interest had already been under the consideration of a Committee, and decided on by the Court.</p>
         <p>Henry Jardine, Esq. begged to mention a fact that the Town of Edinburgh had contributed L.50 to the Infirmary for the last year.</p>
         <p>Mr Ritchie rose and said, that though perfectly aware of what the result would be, he could not allow the matter to be settled without giving Mr Wigham's motion his support. It gave him
            much pleasure to find it was no longer unfashionable to allude to Christian doctrines in such meetings as this,–a change from which he anticipated much good. He concurred in what had been
            said on this subject by the gentleman at the foot of the Table ; but he begged to remind him that it was a great principle of Christianity, that nothing was too trifling to be attended to
            it it promised good; and the additional interest of the money in question would obviously extend the means of healing the sick, the great object of the Institution. Nothing, indeed, which
            had fallen from that gentleman, or the Learned Lord on the other side, could meet or touch the simple proposition, that five per cent is the legal rate of interest, and that the Town of
            Edinburgh ought not to pay less.</p>
         <p>There was another subject alluded to by Mr Wigham, on which, if Mr W. did not, he would submit a motion, namely, Visitori 'And this he conceived was the fittest time for appointing them.
            All sides of the house were, now agreed that the Hospital was admirably conducted. It was impossible, therefore, to suppose that the measure was proposed from any distrust of the Managers.
            If the management was perfect now, it was too much to expect it could continue so ; and this was the proper time for providing against the future. In other places the highest characters in
            the land had acted with visitors ; and much benefit had been derived from them in England, and even at Glasgow. If human nature, therefore, was not different in Edinburgh from wht it is on
            the other side of the Tweed, and in the west of Scotland, it must be admitted that Visitors would be beneficial here also. Besides, as the Managers were aware of their strength, and that
            no measure could be carried here without their consent, the granting of Visitors would be a boon from themselves. He moved, that this Court do annually name 24 or more Visitors to act
            monthly by rotation, and minute such observations as shall occur to them for the consideration of the Managers.</p>
         <p>Mr Wigham seconded the motion ; but as the Court seemed averse to entertain it, it was withdrawn.</p>
         <p>Mr Ritchie then said, that as his last motion was intended chiefly as a caveat to the Committee named by the Lord Provost, he would also, with the same view, state the nature of a motion
            which he wished to submit, but the merits of which he was not then fully prepared to state. it was one, however, of which he was sure it would not be said, that it was introduced for the
            purpose of giving trouble, or unnecessarily occupying the time of the Court. Its object was the promotion of medical science, and its nature would be understood by his reading a single
            paragraph from the able Clinical Reports of Dr Duncan junior. " Almost all hospitals (it is there stated,) publish annual Reports; but in many cases they are intended only to furnish
            information as to the expenditure of the funds, and the names of the office-bearers, and as a public acknowledgement of the support of the subscribers. Such reports, however, are of no use
            in marking the progress of disease, and, except for purposes mentioned above, do positive harm, by causing hospital reports in general to be neglected as utterly without value. This,
            however, is not the case ; and the reports we have of late years received from the Fever Hospitals of Dublin and Cork are worthy of being imitated by hospitals of every kind and in every
            place. Indeed, the public have a right to expect this information in return for their liberality in supporting them. We have only to add, that the most valuable reports often proceed
            entirely from the zeal of the reporters, and are only occasional. This leads us to suggest, that the governors of hospitals should enjoin their regular as a duty upon their medical
            officers ; and we will venture to say, that where it has not yet been practised, its good effects upon the institution in an economical as well as professional points of view, will soon be
            apparent."–His motion went to carry this suggestion into effect ; and without farther preface he should now read it. The substance of it was, that in addition to the Journal kept at
            present, Digest of the whole should be kept in a tabular form but especially of the date of admission, age, sex, and place of residence of the patients ; date of commencement, crisis,
            termination and assigned causes of their diseases ; with a diary of the temperatures and moisture of the atmosphere, state of winds, prices of staple provisions &amp;c. ; with an annual
            medical report, taking notice of the increase or decrease of population, and of the employment, diet and habits of the labouring classes, as far as practicable. Some of the members, he
            observed, seemed to be amused with this enumeration ; but the medical gentlemen would be aware of what he pointed at. With their peculiar and proper duties, he had no wish to interfere.
            They knew them well, and discharged them faithfully and honourably. In their practise they attended to every thing that was necessary ; but their knowledge often died with him ; and his
            object was to preserve the results of their skill and experience.</p>
         <p>The Lord President said he hoped the gentlemen who had made this motion, would see, on reflection, from the labour and time requisite to carry it into effect, how very impracticable it
            would be in an hospital like that of the Royal Infirmary, where the Managers had no compulsory authority over the medical gentlemen, whose time was so occupied with their own private
            avocations.</p>
         <p>The Proposer of the motion said, that instead answering what had fallen from the Right Honourable Judge in his own language, he would beg leave to read another passage from Dr Duncan's
            voluble publication, and which, he hoped, would obviate some of the difficulties adverted to. " The trouble (says Dr Duncan,) of keeping such tabular records, is not so great as might be
            supposed. It requires only system and regularity; and when we see how easily it is done in the military hospital, we cannot help regretting that it is not also in- troduced general into
            civil hospitals. If the practitioner himself has not time to fill up the columns of the prescribed table, it would be very little additional trouble to his clerk ; or if the time of that
            assistant would not easily permit him, the duty would be very gladly taken by another of the Hospital pupils.</p>
         <p>Dr Hope, in a neat and eloquent speech, opposed the motion. The Managers, he said, were willing to give due consideration to every proposal from whatever quarter it might come. The
            present, however, he considered as impractiable. To prepare tabular records of the nature suggested, required great experience, much comprehension and many talents. It was a task which
            every one was not qualified to discharge in a mnner could be beneficial to the public, and one which gentlemen, who lived by their profession, could not be expected to undertake. The case
            was different in military hospitals, where the medical getlmen could devote the whole of their time to their hospital duties. But it should be know, that the materials for making up such
            tables are all recorded in the infirmary Journals ; and that these Journals are open to all the medical attendants; so that whoever finds that he has time and talents for the performance
            of such tasks, has the fullest opportunity for undertaking and completing them. Accordingly we had had the very able reports of Dr Duncan, and the useful work of Dr Welsh. The Institution
            has now the benefit of Dr Duncan's services ; and he considered it better to leave the completion of such works and reports to the zeal and talents of individuals.</p>
         <p>The Mover then stated that he was perfectly aware of Dr. Welsh's judicious publication as well as Dr Duncan's and he certainly would never have introduced such a measure, had it not been
            suggested and recommended by a much abler mind than his own. He had not undertaken the task from any idea that he was able to do it justice, or that he could do it better, or even so well
            as many other members of the Court ; but from the conviction, that if he had not introduced the subject, it would be introduced at all. He had no wish, however to give unnecessary trouble,
            and should, therefore, for the present, beg leave to withdraw his motion.</p>
         <p>Form of Process in the Justiciary Court.</p>
         <p>Our readers will learn with pleasure, that the Lord Advocate, with a laudable anxiety for the honour of our criminal jurisprudence, has announced officially, that the Clerk of Court
            "strikes the Jury, by taking 45 after 45, until they served in rotation. " They consist of a " list of Jurymen furnished by the High Constables" for Edinburgh and those "regularly required
            from the counties of Linlithgow and Haddington," which names " were then put upon a roll, which was put into the bands of the Clerk of Court;"– the Jurors thus struck being cited, not by a
            Sheriff officer, but by a Macer of the Justiciary ourt. We are not aware of any law which requires the Clerk of Court to take the Jurors by rotation ; but it reflects great credit on his
            judgement that he resorts to this unequivocal mode of displaying his impartiality. This is a virtue which the law requires in all its officers ; and it is fortunate when such rules are
            devised and adhered to as make the virtue incontrovertibly visible. At such an advanced stage of society, honour and public opinion will secure impartial justice ; but still, when the
            possibility of some retrograde movement is adverted to, it would be a wise measure to convert what all functionaries do at present from principle, into specific rules for directing the
            conduct of their successors. The Lord Advocate, it has been reported, is about to introduce into Parliament a Bill or Bills respecting the Judicatories of Scotland ; and his Lordship, it
            is obvious, might obtain a well-merited popularity by throwing in some clauses to fix the qualifications of a Juror in the different counties of Scotland, and to regulate the times and the
            manner in which lists of Jurors are to be made up, reduced into a penl of 45, and then to a jury of 15. Ther is, if we mistake not, a cerain discretion on more than one of these points
            left with functionaries, who, we doubt not, would most readily part with it. To them it would be a relief ; and though the arraigned might sometimes have less impartial juries than at
            present, yet, if the ballot were introduced here, as it has recently been in civil cases, the impartiality would be more coguisable, and placed beyond the reach of doubt and
            misrepresentation. It would be no disgrace to Scotland to borrow in this respect from her sister kingdom, but an honour which France seems willing to do herself at present, and which we
            very lately did ourselves in modelling our Jury Court.</p>
         <p>Mr Bywater has construced a small model of a ship in such a manner as to exhibity, by actual experiment, the principal magnetic phenomena mentioned by Captain Flinders, in his voyage to
            New Holland. From a minute attention to the subject, Mr B. has devised a plan, which, in all probability, will remedy, by very simple means, the defect arising from the local attraction
            pointed out by Captain Flinders, and thus be of real advantage to the science of navigation. A drawing of this plan (as it will be important to ships of war) has been sent to the
            Admiralty.</p>

         <p>It should not, however, be forgotten, that, with [?] possible advantage of soil, neighbourhood, [?] climate, emigration to America, a country so [?] from Great Britain, is a matter of deep

         <p>When a man has, after mature deliberation, determined to emigrate, which various considerations may, in particular cases, render prudent, his next question is, Where shall he go–to the
            United States or to Canada? We shall suppose the persons emigrating to be friends to the British constitution; for if they are not, there is no question; because levellers and democrats
            will find themselves in a bad situation in coming to Canada, as they will find no kindred spirits there. But though we can willingly spare such as these, to lose good subjects is a serious
            evil to the empire; and to lose them through ignorance, and the want of that information which it is in our power to give, is a folly, as well as all evil.</p>
         <p>I am persuaded, that all emigrants, of the description we mention, would rather prefer to remain undue their own government, than to live under and swear allegiances to another, provided
            no greater sacrifices were required in going to the one than to the other. I am indeed quite certain, that many would consent willing to a considerable sacrifice for this advantage, so
            agreeable to their feelings and habits; but we shall shew that no such sacrifice is required, and that their interest, as well as inclination, when duly considerd, will lead them to Upper
            Canada.</p>
         <p>In going to the United States, we have Mr. Birkbeck's authority, that 'no good settlement can be made cast of the Alleghany mountains, or in the Atlantic States.' The lands are now so
            dear, as to be in general, far beyond the reach of common emigrants, who have seldom much left after landing in America.</p>
         <p>Suppose two families to land in America–one at New York, or Philadelphia, on the way to Mr Birkbeck's settlement; and one at Quebec, on the way to Upper Canada.</p>
         <p>Miles From Philadelphia to Pittsburgh 320 From Pittsburgh down the Ohio, to Shawanoe Town, 1200 From Shawanoe Town to Mr Birkbeck's settlement, 50 1570</p>

            Shawanoe Town to Mr Birkbeck, for baggage and person, 100 940 To purchase two hundred acres of land, at two dollars per acre 400 Total expenses 1310</p>

            there will be an additiona expense of 80 To such a family, possessed of property, government might grant 200 acres, on paying fees, about 70 Or it may be purchased at two dollars per
            acres, 130 Total expenses, 412</p>
         <p>From this calculation it is seen, that the settler, with his large family, by coming to Upper Canada, instead of joining Mr. Birkbeck, even if he purchases his lands at the same price,
            saves 928 dollars, which will enable him to clear a large portion of his farm, stock it, and build a comfortable house; and if he be granted the land, instead of purchasing it, there is a
            further saving of 130 dollars.</p>
         <p>Let us now see what the product at Mr. Birkbeck's settlement in the Illinois, and in Upper Canada, will command in the market; for, notwithstanding the greatness of the first saving in
            coming to Upper Canada, if the markets be inferior it might soon be balanced.</p>
         <p>Illinois Upper Canada Wheat, per bushel t0 3 9 Wheat, per bushel t0 5 0 India corn, 0 1 1 India corn, 0 4 0 Oats, 0 1 6 Oats, 0 2 6 Hay, per ton 1 19 0 Hay, per ton 2 10 0 Butter, per lb.

            above the truth.</p>
         <p>From this table it is manifest, that the produce raised in Upper Canada sells at an advance of upwards of 30 per cent on what the same can be sold in the Illinois territory, supposing Mr.
            Birkbeck's prices correct, which they are not, being much too high. The vast advantage, therefore, in coming to Upper Canada, must appear manifest.</p>
         <p>It may by some be said, that the families are too numerous, as there are few that consist of ten persons; but the results will be proportionally the same, whatever the number be; and if we
            suppose them to consist of persons in comfortable circumstances in their own country, they will commonly bring servants with them, by which the average will be still greater. But this is
            of no moment; the difference of expense in travelling 500 miles, or 1570, is sufficiently clear.</p>
         <p>We must add, to the disadvantage of Mr. Birkbeck's farmer, the dearness of all those articles which he has to purchase; for his distance from the seacoast and market operates in two ways
            to his disadvantage. 'His produce is low, and the goods from are dear: the shopkeeper, who is at a great distance from the place where the articles he deals in are procured, will add to
            the price, when he disposes of the, the additional expense of bringing, and the time lost in procuring them. To him who is obliged to take a journey of 1600 miles to procure his articles
            of merchandize, the cost and trouble must be very great; and all this he makes the consumer pay. The journey which Mr. Birkbeck's merchant is obliged to take is a very serious one,
            compared to that of the merchant of York or Niagara. The latter, in consequence of this situation, can trade with a smaller capital than the former; because he can at any time procure a
            fresh supply in a few days, while the former can lay in a stock of goods only once a-year. Now, all these difficulties are to be paid for by the farmers and mechanics, who consume the
            articles imported; the difference to them, in the course of a twelvemonth, by receiving less for the articles they sell, and paying more for those they purchase will be found to be very
            great.</p>
         <p>'It is not merely the quantum he shall raise, but the sun he shall get for it, which constitutes the farmer's advantage. It is not simply to get enough to eat and drink that is to bound
            the desires of the farmer; it is to procure the means of converting his log-cabin into a handsome and convenient house– to erect a large barn for his grain, and suitable buildings for his
            cattle–to educate his children–and, as he grows old, to enjoy the satisfaction of finding that his industry has supplied the comforts of life, and enabled him to satisfy the wants of
            society– wants to which we are indebted for amelioration of mankind.'</p>
         <p>In the selection of a place to residence in a new country, it is very important to take into view the ultimate market for the farmer's produce. While the country is settling, there will be
            no difficulty; for the increasing population will demand all the supplies that can be raised. But the prudent settler will look beyond that period, and consider what he shall do when every
            one raises more grain than he will be able to consume. In that case, vicinity to market, and facility of transportation, are all important. Now, the produce of Upper Canada can be sent to
            Montreal, one of the best markets in America in five or six days, at a trifling expense, which is yearly diminishing as the waters are improved. Very different is the case with the farmer
            in the western division of the United States: the immense distance which grain has to be sent, occasions the expense to be so great, as frequently to equal, and sometimes exceed, the price
            offered when it reaches the market. The more that this statement is examined, the more correct it will be found, and the superior advantages of Canada will appear in a stronger light; but,
            having been a landholder, it is time to instruct the emigrant how he is to make his living out of it.</p>

         <p>Necessity of Legislative Measures for Relieving the Distress of the Labouring Classes.</p>
         <p>Salus populi suprema lex.</p>
         <p>T here wasa time when it was held pure factiousness to doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed during the first ten or twelve years of the late war, was perfectly sound and natural, and
            whether it would not ultimately entail upon us a corresponding share of future calamity. But the most gloomy anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the picture on the dark
            side have certainly come infinitely short of the full measure of distress and misery which have at length fallen upon the country. It would be unjust to charge the Government with any more
            of these evils than might have been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on the attention on all sides, it is perfectly fair to hold the Government accountable for all that it can
            remove or prevent, and yet suffers to exist. This is the first time, we believe, in modern history, when the evil of an excess, of population has come so distinctly under the notice of a
            Government as to call for a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new, and the course to be pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a season of bold experiments, in which we
            surmounted many difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if timidity tie up our hands now, when humanity calls upon us to move, the world may well say, that the boasted energy of the
            Government has been entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of the pockets of the people, but that, when a period of public calamity requiress exertions of a more painful
            kind, it is startled by the smallest difficulty, and will not even make such a slight effort as might evince its sympathy with the sufferers.</p>
         <p>During the late war, the industry of the country was stimulated into a state of unprecedented activity, by the monopoly we obtained of the commerce of the world–by thirty or forty millions
            of the capital of the country being annually melted down and consumed–and by the continual rise of prices produced by the depreciation of the currency. The great demand for labour, arising
            out of this state of things, with the consequent increase of wages, caused a rapid augmentation in the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811, the rate of increase in Britain
            was such as would have doubled the population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. When the peace came, and
            was followed by the destruction of our commercial monopoly, the cessation of the annual loans, and the diminuition of the paper issues, the sources of our fictitious prosperity were dried
            up at once : a vast reduction took place in the demand for labour ; profits and wages fell with prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were doubled, and onethird added to their real
            amount by the rise in the value of money. The laws, however, which regulate the multiplication of human beings, cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a long period necessarily elapses
            before the population accommodates itself to the diminished demand for labour, and during this period the labouring classes must suffe extreme misery. In this state we are at present, and
            time, from which we hoped relief, has only aggravated the evil. There are but three remedies upon which any dependence can be placed – a reduction of taxation – a change in our commercial
            system – and emigration. We have little hopes as to the first, since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Government of its own interest, real or supposed, which we see no
            disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commercial system has not the same obstacles to encounter, and we have repeated shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The
            reluctance of Ministers to attempt a change that may prejudice the interest of some particular classes, might be considered as a prudent caution, were it not observed, that when, instead
            of relieving the distress of the people, the object is to suppy the necessities of the Treasury, none of this caution appears, but the complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar
            clamour. But the crisis is now such, that tenderness to the interests of a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at large. Though we shall preach free trade to other nations rather
            with a bad grace, when we can no longer hold our monopoly, it is so far well that our misfortunes are at last likely to open our eyes to truths whch were familiar to philosophers half a
            century ago. In our present circumstances, we may perhaps almost be thankful, that a systematic error, which has impeded our career, has kept this one resource open to us.</p>
         <p>Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a redundant population, that we are rather surprised there should be much reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not be afraid
            that the practise will continue longer than the necessity which produces it. " The vis intertiae of people in general, says Malthus, and their attachment to their homes, are qualities so
            strong and general, that we may rest assured they will not emigrate, unless, from political discontents or extreme poverty, they are in such a state, as will make it as much for the
            advantages of their country as of themselves that they should go out of it. " We by no means underrate the difficulties that attend emigration upon a large scale, but these are partly
            occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclusively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes, whom we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most pressing
            object is to send them where they will find the means of subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our own colonies open to receive them. And whether they go to the United
            States, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, or to Canada, New Holland, or the Cape of Good Hope, the advantage to this country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries of such extent, it would
            not be very difficult to dispose of half a million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps of two years. But upon whatever scale emigration is conducted it must be gradual;
            and this renders it the more important to fix upon a plan early. Ministers have lately announced that Canada cannot receive more emigrants at present without inconvenience. But had the
            intention of sending great numbers to that colony been made public two years ago, corn would have been raised for them, and men of some capital, assured of finding abundance of labourers,
            would have gone out and settled, and provided employment for those who have not the means to establish themselves as farmers. The alarm we feel of seeing manufactures raised up in other
            countries by the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill founded. Many other advantges must be combined with the possession of mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and
            when the former are found, able workmen will not be long wanting. Our capital, our improved means of internal communication, our coal fields, our laws for the protection of industry and
            property, the free, enlightened and active spirit of our people, with the powers of combination resulting from the union of so many advantages within so small a space, are better
            securities for our superiority in manufactures, than attempts, which must be nugatory, to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. But the opinion which exists in foreign
            countries, as to the superiority of our people in every branch of industry, will have this good effect, that it will secure out emigrants a favourable reception. Though the emigration, to
            afford any sensible relief to the whole country, would require to be upon an extensive scale, it is yet obvious, that even upon the smallest scale it is beneficial. If six labourers are
            withdrawn from a small village, or fifty from a country town, the situation of either will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by Government of givingassistance to those only who could
            raise ten on fifteen pounds, is chiefly objectionable, because it must restrict the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away men who are still able to subsist by their
            labour, others now living on charity get employment, we are in effect relieved of so many paupers. But the former are less disposed to leave the country ; and with regard to those who are
            or must soon become paupers, it will certainly be found more economical to pay ten or fiften pounds each to send them abroad, than to maintain them permanently home. It is in vain,
            however, to look to private charity for the funds necessary for such an undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ; and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose, or
            money destined for other objects be applied to this, the country, we have no doubt, is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that even so great a sum as five millions were required, this is
            but the half of what England alone pays every year for poor rates ; and what is such a sum, if it were to afford certain relief on an emergency lke the present? If the French and Dutch
            should again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt, or if we should quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the
            globe, how easily would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing more is requisite than to take on half of the sum for two years, which Mr Vansittart allots for paying off the national
            debt. We not only conceive that it would be wise and creditable to divert a part, or the whole of the actual Sinking Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as to think, that it is little
            less than disgraceful to pay off any debt at all at this crisis with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving population. Whatever is done, it is of vast importance to understand, that
            the most pressing evil, though not absolutely permanent in its nature, cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. We have not only an excess of population to dispose of, but
            we have to check the principle of increase, which is rapidly aggravating the evil. In the five years ending 1810, the population of England added one-seventieth part to its numbers
            annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same for the whole empire, each year must have had 250,000 individuals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the whole of
            this vast annual inrease is got rid of, the present excess of numbers will not diminish but augment. And how is it to be got rid of? Either the annual births must diminish more than
            one-third, or famine and disease must destroy a quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the usual rate of mortality, or these two causes must operate together.
            Notwithstanding, therefore, the misery of the labouring classes at this moment, we doubt whether the population is not still on the increase, and whether still more afflicting scenes are
            not awaiting us. Indeed, unless measures are taken to do away the factitious stimulus which the English poorlaws give to the increase of population, the most abundant emigration will prove
            but a feeble palliative. These are rather discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in some way, or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now become rather a question
            of humanitiy than of policy. One or two millions of human beings have been suddenly deprived of their means of subsistence by events over which they had no control. With such a mass of
            individuals goaded to desperation by want–a deficient crop,–a sudden revulsion in trade– a more general exclusion of our manufactures by the Americans,–any of those numerous casualties, in
            short to which every nation is exposed, would place us in a situation frightful to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a continual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be
            safe, and capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent, experience must now convince us, that time alone will produce no material amelioration in our circumstances ; and
            the relief which is may ultimately bring, will be obtained only through the destruction of vast multitudes by famine and disease. In the fifth year of peace, it is now time to look the

         <p> Extract of a letter received from Calcutta, dated 22d November, 1819:--"An afflicting circumstance has recently taken place. The Captain of the Bengal, a Liverpool trader, very lately
            gave a ball on board his ship, which was about to sail for England. The party was very small, and more than half were taken ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards. I buried the
            Captain and the Surgeon a few days after it; not less than ten of the part died within as many days, all younger persons. Only one officer survives of those who left England in the ship,
            and he is just recovering in the Hospital. All sorts of conjectures were made, but it turns out that there were 17,000 undressed buffalo horns in the hold, in a complete state of
            putrefaction. This vessel has sailed for England in this state without a Surgeon. I question whether it will ever arrive; it ought not to be admitted among other shipping if it does;–the
            opening of the hold will be death to him who does it, and perhaps to many more."--In consequence of this disastrous information, Ministers have issued an order for the vessel, on her
            arrival at Liverpool, or any other part, to undergo quarantine.– London Paper.</p>
         <p>All apprehension on the above subject is completely done away by the following letter from Liverpool, May 14:–</p>
         <p>"I noticed a paragraph in the London papers, respecting the Bengal, of this port, at Calcutta, stating that a number of deaths had taken place, supposed in consequence of the Infectious
            vapours arising from some buffalo horns.–The Bengal arrived here April 5, and has been discharged without any of those dreadful consequences which the medical gentlemen of Calcutta
            prognosticated.–I should rather suppose that the fatal consequences which ensued to those individuals who attended the ball given on board this vessel at Calcutta, would be none justly
            attributed to the exposure to night air."</p>

         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>The following is an extract of a private letter dated</p>
         <p>"Halifax, May 22 "At two o'clock this day the Earl of Dalhousie, Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of British North America, attended by the Admiral, his Majesty's Council, the staff,
            naval and military officers, and the principal people of the place, attended to lay the first stone of a new college, to be erected at the north end of the grand parade. The whole of the
            freemasons of Halifax went in grand procession. They formed in lodges at their hall, and, preceded by a military band, and followed by another, they marched to the places prepared for them
            on the building.</p>
         <p>"His Lordship came on the scaffolding at two o'clock, the grenadiers of the 62d regiment being his guard of honour. Detachments from each regiment kept the ground.</p>
         <p>"After a prayer by the Rev. Mr Twining, Grand Chaplain, Lord Dalhousie addressed the assembly in a speech, of which I have not time to give an outline ; but in it his Lordship mentioned,
            that the building was intendeed as a college upon the plan of that of Edinburgh, where all students who professed the Christian religion were eligible for admittance. Strangers residing
            here for a short time might also enjoy the benefit of the institution, and gentlemen in the army, the navy, and the military establishments. His Lordship concluded a most eloquent and
            animated address with his fervent wishes for the welfare and prosperity of the undertaking.</p>
         <p>"A bottle with coins, and a tin case with parchments, &amp;c. were then severally deposited in the recess made for them, and the stone was lowered into its place with all the requisite and
            due forms, under a royal salute from fort Charlotte ; after which the Rev. the Grand Chaplain closed the proceedings with a prayer, and the whole assembled multitude gave nine cheers.– The
            military and masonic processions then returned in the same order, in which they came.</p>
         <p>The day was beautiful, and a greater assemblage of people was never witnessed in Halifax.</p>
         <p>"The Countess of Dalhousie and her two sons, Mrs Admiral Griffith and the Misses Wilson, and most of the fashionable ladies here witnessed the ceremony from a convenient scaffolding
            prepared for them.</p>
         <p>"Lord Dalhousie purposes to leave Halifax for Quebec in his Majesty's ship Newcastle, on the 1st of June, without waiting for Sir James Kempt."</p>
         <p>Court of Chancery –June 10.</p>
         <p>Will of the Late Duke of Queensberry Mr Head stated, that he had to present a petition from the annuitants and legates of the late Duke of Queensberry, praying that a fourth more of their
            claims might be paid, there now being sufficient funds in the hands of the Accountant-General for that purposes. The Learned Counsel said, that there was no less a sum than L.1,400,000
            accumulated and vested in the name of this officer, in Bank stock, for the benefit of the claimants, and he understood it was not intended to oppose the application, although the executors
            did not say they would give their consent to it. Some consultation had been had on the subject out of doors ; he therefore prayed that the prayer of the petition should be granted.</p>
         <p>The Attorney-General said, he had not received any instructions, nor had he been consulted.</p>
         <p>The several King's counsel in Court spoke in behalf of their respective clients.</p>
         <p>Mr Wingfield appeared for the Earl of Yarmouth, and said his Lordship was anxious that the business should be put in a train of settlement.</p>
         <p>The Lord Chancellor said, there was not a man existing that had a heart in him but must wish the legacies and annuities to be paid ; but, said his Lordship, the Marquis of Queensberry has
            commenced an action for the recovery of L.150,000 against the executor, and he certainly had a right so to do it ; it was, therefore, proper that the Court should see that no harm arose to
            the executors, before the funds were allowed to go out of Court. With respect to their not opposing the petition, that was very different to consenting to it ; it merely said to the Court,
            " Mind you do right."</p>
         <p>Mr Heald said, if his Lordship thought that one-fourth was too much, they would take an eight, or any part his Lordship pleased.</p>
         <p>The Lord Chancellor.–I will order it to stand first on the paper for Tuesday next, and in the mean time I will look over the petition.</p>

         <p>The New York Daily Advertiser says–"The line of battle ship New York, now finishing at our navy yard, at the Wallabut, is perhaps the most superior vessel ever built. Her tonnage is near
            3000[?]: she measures 203 feet keel, and is by 15 feet the largest man of war ever laid down in this country. She will no doubt be rated a 74, but will be equal to a 100 gun-ship, and will
            carry 120 guns."</p>

         <p>India</p>
         <p>We have great pleasure in publishing the following interesting letter from India: –</p>
         <p>"Madras, Feb. 4, 1820. "I have, thank God, no very brilliant events to communicate to you, but if the happiness of man is the legitimate object of all Government, it is good to learn that
            British India is at peace, and that a temperate and radical reform is gradually going on under the Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establishment of schools, and a free press, are
            the moving principles by which this great advancement in the state of society will be accomplished, unless checked by impious powers.</p>
         <p>"On the subject of these schools, it is not necessary here to dilate. Suffice it to observe, that it is in the power of any Government, abitrary or free, to educate the great bulk of its
            subjects, and thereby to advance them in knowledge, civilization, and happiness, in the shortest possible period.</p>
         <p>"The establishment of a free press in Asia is, in my estimation, as useful and magnanimous an art as ever adorned the biography of any Statesman. What, say its detractors, is setting loose
            a parcel of printer's devils so great an act? No, but setting loose all the intelligence of the age to work upon the public mind and conduct, is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it
            asserted that a free press is only applicable to an advanced state of society, I deny the position ; it is not founded in reason or experience. I contend on the other hand, that where
            least knowledge and msot evil exist, there is the greatest scope for improvement ; and I offer Scotland as a proof of the efficacy[?] of education and a free press.</p>
         <p>"The Marquess of Hastings, Governor General of India, has, in the newspapers of Madras and Calcutta, been accused of having sent two persons of the name of Hastings, to unhealthy climates,
            the one to the East and the other to the West Indies, where they died ; and for the base purpose of securing to his family the title of Huntingdon. This, you must be aware, was touching
            his sensitive honour to the quick ; and it would seem as if some one inimical to a free press, had introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this virtuous man, who would not tread on
            an insect, allowed this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood refuted in every bosom, and his manly forbearance tended but to give further proofs of his attachment to our infant
            liberty. Attacks have likewise been made on Sir E. East, our Chief Justice. He complained, they say, of these alleged libels to the Chief Magistrate, who desired him to have recourse to
            the law Conceive not, however, that I am the advocate for a licentious press. My maxim is, that a great power, when mischievously applied, must be hurtful, and when well applied,
            beneficial, in proportion to its strength.</p>
         <p>"You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, has done away with the Censorship of the Press. This wise Statesman, being a friend to freedom, and having experienced
            the benefits which had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light by the press), adopted it the moment he came into power, and
            thus proved himself a public benefactor.</p>
         <p>"To conclude, it is my firm conviction, that the diffusion of knowledge, through the medium of education and a free press, will more than any other measure accelerate the improvement and
            heighten the prosperity, not only of British India, but of the surrounding world."</p>

            Spanish ship, of 300 tons, armed with 14 guns and two stern chasers, and full of men. She was supposed to have been out two or three months from Cuba. She had a yellow waist, woman head,
            painted black, and was coppered to light water mark.</p>
         <p>Intelligence from Marseilles, dated 22d inst. states –' An English Captain, who left Oran on the 13th inst. and arrived yesterday in this port, has declared that a squadron of five armed
            ships, which he was assured were destined for the North Seas, sailed from Algiers at the beginning of the present month."</p>
         <p>A vessel, the Prompt sailed on Tuesday evening from Greenock for Quebec, having on board emigrants from Anderston, Rutherglen, Lesmahogow, and Lanark, to the number of about 350 persons.
            The Rev. Mr Easton, of Montreal, goes out with the Prompt.</p>

         <p>A new island has been discovered off Cape Horn, in inst. 61 deg. long. 55 deg. by the ship William, on a voyage from Monte Video for Valparaiso. The same having been dispatched by Captain
            Sheriff, of the Andromache frigate, to survey the coast, had explored it for 200 miles. The captain went ashore found it covered with snow, and uninhabited. Abundance of seals an whales
            were found in its neighbourhood. He has named the island New Shetland.</p>
         <p>Accounts from Constantinople, dated May 26, annouce, that the armaments against Ali Pacha are upon the most formidable scale, and are actively pursued.– The latter has obtained hostages of
            his principal officers, as pledges of their fidelity. On the 14th, two new ships of the line were launched in the presence of the Sultan and his Grand Dignitaries, at the hour fixed by the
            chief astrologers. The navigation between Bagdad[?] and Bassurah has been free since the defeat of the Arabs by the English. The latter, it is stated, have facilitated the intercourse
            between those two places by the establishment of parket-boats.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Proposed New Monarchy in South America</p>
         <p>Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres, by the Blossom sloop of War, of a curious nature.– They relate to a project said to have been in agitation for placing a Prince of the House
            of Bourbon at the head of an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.– The circumstance has been brought to light by the late changes in the Government of Buenos Ayres. From the
            documents now published, and received by the Blossom, it appears that in June, 1819. Gomez the Envoy from Buenos Ayres, at Paris, was invited to a conference by M. De Cazes, then French
            Minister for Foreign Affairs, the object of which was to communicate a project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolidation of the Independent Government of South America.</p>
         <p>This project, the French Minister observed, would meet with the decided approbation of the Continental Powers, especially Russia and Austria. Great Britain might not like it, but yet would
            not find any good pretence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would yield to the influence of all Europe with the better grace, as his former dependencies would be only
            transferred to a branch of his own family. The King of France would furnish assistance of every king, and employ every means, even to the supply of troops, for carrying the affair into
            execution.</p>
         <p>On the 26th of October last, when the statement of his conference reached Buenos Ayres, Rondeau, then Director ad interim made a secret communication to the Congress, and transmitted to
            them the letter of the Envoy, together with the French memorial ; on the following day, and on the 3d of November, the matter was discussed in secret meetings, and the result was an[?]
            opinion, that the Constitution lately-sworn allowed no alteration to be made in the form of Government till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch of the Bourbon family, so
            closely connected with the reigning Monarch of Spain, was in itself an insuperable objection, as also the consideration that the Prince proposed and supported by the Powers of the European
            Continent, would naturally more incline towards the views of his protectors than towards those of South America, which ought to avoid all connexion with European continental politics ; and
            that Great Britain was the power from which South America had most to fear, and most to expect.</p>
         <p>It was at the same time suggested, that the Envoys in Europe shoud put the communications from Paris into the hands of the British Minstry, whose good opinion and protection South America
            is most anxious to conciliate.</p>
         <p>Our Cabinet has always treated the South Americans with the greatest reserve, as if feating contamination by simple contact–a delicacy towards Spanish interests and feelings which appears
            in itself commendable, but, when measured by the standard of national benefit, may not merit the same praise. As it is, it would seem that the British interest is likely to gain the
            ascendacy in the river Plate, rather through the disposition of the inhabitants, than from any influence exerted by our Ministers.</p>
         <p>We shall only add, that thought the negotiation was carried on by the Duke de Cazes, the project did not originate with him, and did not at first apply to the Prince de Lucca. It was
            intended as an opening for one more nearly allied to the reigning family in France.</p>

         <p>Emigration.</p>
         <p>We extract the following statement from the Montreal Herald and an important one it is, to those who are desirous of emigrating, as well as to those, who, from patriotic motives, would
            wish to turn the tide of emigration into a channel which, while it relieve the mother country now, may hereafter add to her strength and resources :</p>
         <p>Number of British subjects that emigrated to the United States, who received recommendations for grants of land, and removed to the province of Upper Canada, from James Buchanan, Esq. his
            Majesty's Consul at New York, in the year 1819 : –</p>
         <p>English { Farmers..... 180 Women..... 118 Children..... 157 Mechanics..... 117 Women..... 57 Children..... 92 } 1021 Scotch { Farmers..... 50 Women..... 11 Children..... 15 Mechanics.....
            30 Women..... 9 Children..... 36 } 131 Irish { Farmers..... 184 Women..... 94 Children..... 319 Mechanics..... 75 Women..... 42 Children..... 98 } 810 Total.........1962</p>
         <p>We cannot give publicity to the above return, without observing how eminently calculated such a document is, to open the eyes of our too credulous, yet industrious and loyal countrymen ;
            many of whom are still disposed to look to the United Statesm, as the abode of independence and the source of affluence. Here we see nearly 2000 British subjects, who, in one season,
            through the agency alone of one of our Consuls(withoutany pecuniary aid), have removed from the United States to Upper Canada. Their trieal and failure in the former, as well as the trial
            and failure of the great numbers who have returned to this country, are circumstances well calculated to direct the attention of those who have emigration in view, at once to Upper Canada.
            We have made enquiry about these hitherto unknown, but truly fertile regions ; and we are informed from a most authentic and satisfactory source, that there there are unlocated lands,
            fertile beyond the conception of those who have not seen them, capable of receiving ten millions of inhabitants ; that the winters are not so cold, nor the summers so hot, as in the State
            of New York ; that these regions have proved eminently healthy to the vast numbers that have poured into them of late years ; and that the administration of the laws, the state of
            education and religious instruction, and above all, the peace and quiet of the inhabitants have found there, have exceed their most sanguine expectations.</p>
         <p>It may be desirable to state, that grown persons can get by water from Quebec to York, the capital of Upper Canada, for about 28s ; children, half price ; that to all persons properly
            recommended as to good conduct, a grant of land is given according to their means of cultivation ; that this grant becomes their own for ever, and they may dispose of it as they
            please.</p>

         <p>Colony at the Cape of Good Hope</p>
         <p>(Extract of a Letter, dated off Madeira ) Aurora Transport Ship, Feb 19.</p>
         <p>"An opportunity having offered for transmitting a hasty account of the Aurora and Brilliant transports, proceeding with settlers to the Cape of Good Hope, I feel happy in availing myself
            of that circumstance, with a view as well to gratify our friends in England, as to add another confirmation of the liberality of Government in our important undertaking. First, it will be
            necessary to state, that the two ships sail in company, and are every day within hail of each other ; the former commanded by Captain Pearson, and the latter by Captain Bothwell, who is
            accompanied by Lieutenant Pritchard, as agent to both vessels.</p>
         <p>"We sailed from Gravesend on. Our course down Channel was most favourable, and the weather has hitherto been propitious. No death, disease, or serious accident has occurred in either ship
            and blooming health and vigour now rapidly succeed the langour produced by a sudden transition to a new element. Provisions, consisting of flour, currants, suet[?] oatmeal, peas, butter,
            cheese, tea, sugar, biscuit, salt pork, and beef, of excellent quality, are liberally supplied, together with a proper allowance of rum, vinegar, mustard and spices. The ships are fitted
            up in every respect comfortably and commodiously, and the most perfect harmony prevails, if we except bickerings amongst the old women about fractured teapots and mislaid culinary
            articles. The attention paid to the comfort of the passengers, and more especially to that of the women and children, by the Captains, and the agent (Mr Pritchard), is highly creditable to
            the instructions received from Government.</p>
         <p>"Although I do not sail in the same ship Captain Bothwell. I have had ample proofs of the kindness and humane liberality which he shews to the passengers in the Brilliant. Captain Pearson
            is an active, intelligent officer, who has been 23 years in the Transport Service under Government : he has sailed to almost every part of the world, and Algoa Bay, our place of
            destination, is quite familiar to him.</p>
         <p>"It may be egotism to speak of myself; but I trust I may be excused in boasting, that of the crew and 240 passengers, not one is seriously indisposed at present, and wishing, with
            heartfelt sincerity, to my friends in England, happiness, peace, and tranquility, in as good health as I now enjoy, long may they live, long live the Constitution: and while on Fish River
            or Orange River we encounter the difficulties incident to new colonists, may England and South Africa be ever united by the ties of mutual friendship–the one affording her parental arms,
            and the other mindful of her filial duty. P. Campbell., Surgeon.</p>

         <p>We have received letters and papers, from the Cape of Good Hope, to the 22d October, and they are satisfactory in all points of view, but especially with reference to the new settlement at
            Algoa Bay. His Excellency, the Governor, Sir R. S. Donkin, was taking some effectual measures to place the coinage of the colony upon a better footing, and on the 13th of October he issued
            a Proclamation for destroying a very large quantity of base money. He has also taken measure to communicate to the new settlers from England the full benefit ofthe Courts of Justice
            esblished in that quarter of the world.</p>
         <p>We have received an account of the loss of the Abeona[?] transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope, with settlers. The following is an extract of a letter from the Agent to Lloyd's, dated
            Lisbon, 20th Dec. "The Condessa da Ponte, which arrived on the 20th inst. from Marenham[?], has brought 49 persons, who escaped from the Abeona transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope,
            which took fire and was burnt on the 25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long–and 113 lives were lost. The Agent, Lieut. Madge, the Captain, Surgeon, 21 men, 16 boys, 4 women, and 5 girls, got into
            three boats, and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da Ponte, the morning after the fatal event."</p>
         <p>Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received, which give detailed accounts of the number and state of the slaves in that part of the West Indies. The report is given by James
            Robertson, Esq. the new Slave Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial statement of the slave population, and the Reporter makes some judicious comparative remarks. It appears
            that there has been a large decrease of the number by deaths, but the Creoles are greatly increased as compared with the former year. Births have been in the proportion of one to
            forty-six. The Report defends the [?] of the West India Planters, and observes that the state of the Black population serves[?] to evil for little or no [?] ; so great is the kindness, the
            liberality, and induglent care of propiertors. It adds, that their own interests is a perpetual[?] evil[?] upon their humanity. In the colony there [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]
            slaves on the island, [?] Africans[?] and Creoles and there are 38,910 female slaves of the same donomination, making a total of 76,929. The slave population in 1817, amounted in the whole
            to 77,867.– The number of births which have occurred since that period is 5,317, and deaths 7,140. The Report concludes with some gratifying observations upon the flourishing state of the
            colony.</p>

         <p>Enquiries and applications having been addressed to the Colonial Department respecting emigration to His Majesty's foreign possessions, it has been deemed convenient, with a view to the
            information and guidance of individuals interest in this subject, to state, that, 1 stly, Persons are not provided with passages, at the public expense to any of his Majesty's settlements.
            2 dly, Persons proceeding at their own expense to North America, and to the Cape of Good Hope, and desirous of settling there, require no previous authority from his Majesty's Secretary of
            State to enable them to obtain grants of land, the Governor of those settlements being fully empowered to assign lands to applicants, proportioned to the means which they actually possess
            for bringing them into a state of cultivation. The extent of these grants must depend upon their quality, position, and other circumstances, which can only be ascertained in the Colony. 3
            dly, Persons desirous of settling in New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land must be provided with the sanction of his Majesty's Secretary of State ; and this can only be obtained upon
            written application, accompanied by references to two or more respectable persons, as to the character of the applicant, and the extent of his capital, which must amount to Five Hundred
            Pounds, at the least.</p>

         <p>Success of the Cutch Expedition against the Sindeans –The following extract of a letter from Bombay bringing this intelligence, we copy from Carrick's Post, which appears to have exclusive
            means of obtaining information on India affairs:–</p>
         <p>"Bombay, Sept. 12, 1820. "While I was seeing the last of your goods on board, last night, a vessel arrived in the harbour having on board an officer from Cutch, who was the hearer of the
            official intelligence of the complete success of Sir Charles Culville's expedition against the Sindeans. The expedition consisted of 12,000 men, commanded by his Excellency the Commander
            in Chief ; from all I could clean of intellience from the followers, it appeared there had been some hard fighting for five days ; but it ended, as might be anticipated, from the imposing
            force sent against the Sindeans. The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff, and an Irishman) landed, he set out for the Government House, to inform Lady Colville of the event, as it
            must be supposed she was in a state og anxiety, her husband being the commander, and her brother, and her uncle, Colonel T. Blair, being also on the expedition. At day-light this morning
            orders arrived from the Government House, to secure a passage and private cabin for the officer in th ship which takes this to England, but there was no such accomodation, as the cabins
            were all full ; and as another vessel will not sail from thence about ten days, this and will be off to-day, the chance is, you will have this letter at least six weeks before the officers
            can reach England with the official intelligence. All kinds of European produce are a drug hee, paricularly fine goods ; and rum, brandy, and geneva, are for a song. The cholera has rather
            abated, but still rages in a frightful manner."</p>
         <p>The Rio Janeiro packet arrived on Tuesday with letters to the 21st of November. Advices had been received from Rio Grande, stating that Artigas had been taken prisoner. The Portuguese
            frigate, Union, had captured two insurgent privateers which had been committing depredations on the coast. The events in Portugal, owing to which, as well as to the idea that the King
            would be prudent enough to sanction what had taken place in Portugal, the prices of produce had experienced very trifling alteration, though, if the contrary should be the case, a
            considerable rise was anticipated. The following relates to what is passing in Peru :–</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro, dated November 20 :–" The Chilians have at length carried into effect their boasted expedition, which left Valparaiso on the 21st August, and arrived
            at Pisco at the beginning of September. San Martin landed 4,500 men, but the blacks, cattle, &amp;c. had all been previously sent away from the estates in that quarter, so that they will
            be disappointed in meeting with partisans ; indeed the slaves and lower orders, whom they expected to find favourable to their views, are the most irritated against the insurgents. We have
            letters from Lima to the 12th September, which speaks of the little apprehensions entertained of San Martin and his troops, the Viceroy having a formidable force, in the capital and
            vicinity, of 8,000 men, commanded by good officers. The Viceroy, is Commander-in-Chief, La Serna, second, and La Mar and O'Reilly command divisions. They were observin San Martin's
            movements who already experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men. The Marquis of Vallembrozo was on his flank, with a strong detachment of cavalry, with a view to prevent him from
            sending emissaries into the interior, and collecting horses. It is thought the insurgents will soon have to re-embark ; for, as soon as they are a little pressed for provisions, and
            fighting comes on, numbers will desert. Those who have already come over describe their situation as very critical. Two vessels, one an English, and the other a French, were preparing to
            sail from Callao for this place, and by them we shall receive further particulars. The most enthusiastic preparations were making in Lima to proclaim the constitution in a formal manner,
            for which purpose orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself is sufficient to defeat all views Cochrane and San Martin may have on the country, except, as before, a little
            plunder on the open and defenceless parts of the coast.</p>
         <p>Letters from Sierra Leone, dated the 24th of Nov. mention that the whole squadron was lying there.– The Pheasant, Myrmidon, Snapper, and Thistle, were lying off the Cape, waiting for the
            Morgiana to complete her water, provisions, &amp;c. which ship was obliged to be assisted by the squadron, in consequence of her very sickly state. She had recently arrived from the River
            Gambia, whither she had proceeded in dread of attack by the natives on our infant colony there. A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason, by the merchants of that colony, for
            the very able manner in which he brought to an amicable conclusion the differences between the Native Chiefs and the British interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from the Gambia,
            Dr Dochard and forty-six men belonging to the mission under Major Gray, for exploring Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but, in consequence of internal wars, he was unable to proceed
            further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; he will not proceed further for some time.</p>

         <p>Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 16th of December have been received. It is satisafactory to learn that some more effectual measures, than any before adopted by the French Government, to
            prevent slave trading are now in a course of execution. The French brig of war, Le Huron, of 22 guns, Commodore Du Pressit, is employed in cruizing for that purpose.</p>
         <p>Earthquake at Zante, Jan. 8.–The last week has been a scene of horror and destruction at Zante.– At four o'clock, on the morning of the 29th of Dec. we had a violent shock of an
            earthquake, which lasted nearly half a minute ; this was followed by eight other shocks, between four and six o'clock, which threw down one thousand three hundred houses. Providentially,
            the first shock did not throw down many, so that the inhabitants had time to escape before succeeding shocks, otherwise theloss would have been dreadful. Only ten lives have been lost, but
            not a house in the town has escaped without some injury. The town is still in a complete state of confusion ; one thousand give hundred houses more, being so much injured as to be marked
            in order to be pulled down ; all the steeples in the place must be taken down. The streets are almost impassable from the fallen houses ; and great caution is required, in walking, to
            avoid the ruins that are still falling.</p>

         <p>Emigration to Canada</p>
         <p>The following is an extract of a letter from a tradesman belonging to Glasgow, who has been six years in Upper Canada, to a friend in this city :–</p>
         <p>" York, Upper Canada, 14th November, 1820. "You wish to be informed of the encouragement that you might meet with by an emigration to this country; and as you have determined to place the
            most implicit confidence in what I may advance. I shall therefore state to you the "truth, and nothing but tl[?] truth, so help me God."– In the first place, you wish to know what might be
            the value of a hundred acres of land, with six or eight acres of improvement. This is a question that I cannot give a decided answer to, as it depends entirely on the situation where you
            wish to purchase; but I may with safety average wild land, in this Upper Province, say at 4 to 6 dollars per acre, and the clearing or improving of each acre will cost you from 16 to
            20dollars.–In the next place, you wish to know the price of cattle. They have never been known to be cheaper than at the present time. A cow can be purchased at 20 dollars, a pair of
            working oxen at 40 dollars; a good cart horse at 50 dollars,; sheep, 2 dollars apiece. In regard to farming utensils, there are but few used in this country at any time, and a new settler
            may be some years in the woods before we want any more than an axe, (3 dollars) a plough, (10 dollars) and a harrow, (5 dollars.)–You wish to know the nature of a Government grant; that
            has now become no object, as the charges made by Government exceed in many cases what you can purchase land for; and by buying land you have the advantage of choosing a situation agreeable
            to your mind; but the reverse is the case when you accept of a grant from Government, for you must then take your chance by drawing by lottery; and as the land is already taken up for
            forty miles round this place, you will then be obliged to go back into the woods, and out of the world. You are at liberty to sell it as soon as you receive the grant; formerly you
            could.–You wish to know what sum you could establish yourself for in this country as a farmer. There is one thing obvious–the more you bring the less miseries and difficulties you will
            have to undergo. But as a true friend, I would advise you not to think of leaving home with a sum less than t200 sterling with a sum less than this you undoubtedly subject yourself to
            hardships and troubles that you have no idea of. Though many have settled here for nothing, their fate has been such that it is beyond my pend to describe; and my greatest enemy I should
            not advise to come to this country, with the intention of farming, with less capital than I have no stated to you. Many may flatter you, and stuff your head with golden dreams about this
            country; but you must allow the experience that I have had to outweigh the statements of many that you may have had an opportunity of talking with, who may pretend to have some knowledge
            of this country, for there are but few settlements between Montreal and the falls of Niagara (a distance of nearly 600 miles,) that I have not visited.–As to the necessaries wanted for a
            family who may think of coming to this country, I should entirely confine myself to wearing apparel, as clothes are the highest article in this country; and should you think of farming, I
            would advise you to bring but few fine clothes, but principally coarse and stout. Heavy luggage of any kind becomes very expensive and cumbersome bringing you up the river so far as this,
            and is often liable to be damaged, in consequence of the repeated re-shipping. The rate of charge of the transportation of good from Montreal to Kingston (200 miles) is 2 dollars per cwt.;
            and from Kingston to York (200 miles) they charge 1 dollar for each barrel bulk; and from Montreal to York you may get a passage for 10 dollars for each grown person.–By the by, you wish
            to know the population of this town: it is indeed small in comparison to some of your towns; but I might say that the inhabitants of York might amount to 3000 people. But there is no place
            that I have visited in my travels that is more thriving than this town; and as a proof, I can safely say that it is now twice the size that it was when I came here, (now three years), and
            still continuing to increase greatly in buildings; but all wood.–You wish to know the different branches of business carried on here. They are principally house carpenters; and various
            other mechanics are also employed here.–You wish to know if any of the emigrants have arrived in this place. There are but very few I understand come thus far, the greater part of them
            having stopped at a settlement called Perth, about miles below Kingston. –Since I have now given answers to all your different queries, let me now give my candid opinion respecting this
            country. In the first instance, a farmer may live by hard labour; that is, he may acquire a livelihood; but cash[?] is a complete hidden treasure, and is as forbidden fruit to the farmer
            of this country; and in some places you may live for years and not even behold, a silver dollar through a glass darkly, as all is done by barter in the country. The next evil is the
            mixture of society; a very few good, intermixed with a multitude of a very different character; but in many places you will be divested of all society, either of a good or bad quality; in
            either of which situations I am afraid you will find yourself uncomfortable, in consequence of its being so much different to what you have been accustomed to; and the opportunity of
            spending the sabbath in a religious worship you will also find wanting. And above all evils the fever and ague, that none escape, is the ruin of many a family in this country. But should
            you think of coming to this country, in order to avoid this disease I would advise you to come no farther up the country than Perth settlement, where this loathsome sickness is seldom
            known. Now, my friend, by what I have stated here I neither mean to advise or dissuade you from coming to this country; but take it into serious consideration before you embark upon this
            important."</p>

         <p>Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada Quebec Legislative Council–March 17.</p>
         <p>This day his Excellency the Governor in Chief made the following[?] speech to both Houses:–</p>
         <p>"Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly,</p>
         <p>"When the Parliament met for the dispatch of public business[?], I did entertain a hope that the experience of the [?] few years would have led you to a mature and serious consideration[?]
            of the consequences that would inevitably follow[?], if the then state of things should not be remedied ; I[?] cannot therefore be surprised that I should now express[?] not only my
            disappointment, but great concern that [?] same question of constitutional principle should have [?]ia disturbed the unanimity of your legislative proceedings[?].</p>
         <p>"Upon this occasion I think it a duty which I owe to [?] and to your country to call upon you to consider, during[?] this summer, the result of the discussions of the sessesion[?] in all
            its bearings.</p>
         <p>"You will see the administration of the civil government[?] left without any pecuniary means but what I shall advance[?] upon my own personal responsibility ; you will [?] individuals
            suffering under severe and unmerited hardships[?], caused by the wast of that constitutional authority that[?] is necessary for the payment of the expences of the civil[?] government. You
            will see the interior improvements[?] of the country nearly at a stand ; you will see, in [?]ort, the executive government in a manner palsied and powerless[?].</p>
         <p>"When I shall again summon you to meet here in Parliament[?], you will come to decide the important question, whether[?] the Government shall be restored to its constitutional[?[ energy,
            or whether you are to deplore the prospect [?] lasting misfortune, by a continuance in the present state [?] things. Important as that question is, there can be no difficulty[?[ in the
            decision. When the blessingsof the British[?] constitution were granted to this province, you re[?]ved with it the recorded experience of centuries of [?]ctise. There is no question of
            doubt or of difficulty [?]that may not find its precedent in the records of the Im[?]Imperial Parliament ; and I cannot thik that any wiser [?]guide need by desired."</p>
         <p>After which, the Honourable Speaker of the Legislative [?]council said, that it was the pleasure of his Excellency the [?]Governor in Chief that the Provincial Parliament should [?]
            prorogued until Thursday, the 26th of April next.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>We have received Canada Papers to the 10th May. The active exertions of the Governor to improve the inland navigation had given very general satisfaction. In the course of the Session of
            the Colonial Parliament, which was prorogued on the 14th April, no less than three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhousie, to be forwarded to the King ; one respecting the allowance of
            half-pay to the Militia ; another respecting the duties imposed in British ports on lumber from Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained by the people of Canada, during the late
            war. His excellency the Governor had intimated, that no objection would be made to the repeal of the grant of 2,500l on account of the Civil List for the Colony, provided the salaray of
            the Chief retired Justice, the ReceiverGeneral, and that of the Speaker of the House of Assembly, should be continued, in the whole amounting to 1,800l. The grant has for some time been a
            prominent subject of complaint in the Colonial Parliament.</p>
         <p>The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in Lower Canada is about to leave the Colony for England. The Staff Corps was to proceed to the Ottawa, to carry into effect the intended plan
            for removing the obstructions in that river.</p>
         <p>An article from Montreal, dated May 5, states, that a messenger was leaving that place to announce the union of the North and Hudson's Bay Companies, at their respective establishments.
            The former of these companies was under control of Lord Selkirk, and the schism that has so long reigned between them, with its fatal consequences, is well know to the Public.</p>
         <p>By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships have been taken up by the vigilant Governor, on board of which 5000 troops are embarked, destined to the Persian Gulph, to repair the disaster
            suffered by the surprise of the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier, under the direction of a young man. The gallant Gen. Lionel Smith has been selected for this important service ; and we
            have no doubt but that he will convince the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceedings, and justify the high confidence which the Government of Bombay have in his talents and
            valour.– His Excellency Mr. Elphinstone, completely recovered, is gone on a tour to Kutch, to settle all disputes, and to ascertain the true situation of the country.– How important it is
            for the Heads of the Presidencies, thus to judge from actual observation, instead of trusting to mere reports. This proves the benefits of appointing men of experience and energy in the
            conduct of our Indian Empire–which is now, throuh the admirable conduct of the Governor General, and the two other Presidencies, in a state of unexampled, tranquility and prosperity.</p>

         <p>Van Dieman's Land</p>
         <p>We have been favoured with the following extract of a letter from Captain Dixon, of the ship Skelton, dated Hobert Town, Van Dieman's Land, 29th November 1820 :–</p>
         <p>"We arrived here on the 27th inst. all in good health.– This colony surpasses my expectation–climate very similar to England, soil capable of any thing, where an industrious manhas every
            thing to hope and nothing to fear ; the assistance given to settlers liberal, and grants of land to the amount of from 400 to 2000 acres given them, generally of excellent quality. This
            colony in fact is the only country that an Englishman should come to, he neither changes climate not habits, for here every thing hat occurs to him is the same, except burning wood for
            coals. The country on the sea coast is very woody, but much easier cleared than America and about ten miles in the interior several miles of extent have no wood at all. The ships behaves
            beautifully, sails well, and is easy ; we have never close reefed and not above twice double reefed, and not strained a rope yarn nor split a sail."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter received by My Leyden, R. N. Leith, from his Son, Mate of the ship Skelton, dated Sullivan's Cove, off Hobart Town, 29th November 1820 :–</p>
         <p>"I take this opportunity of sending you a few lines by the ship Guildford, which is to sail tomorrow for Baravia, and then homewards. We left the Table Bay on 18th October, and arrived
            here on 28th November, making a very good passage. Did not see any vessel on the passage–made the island of Amsterdam and St Paul's on 28 November–went ashore on the island of Amsterdam
            for two or three hours, found it to be barren entirely–only inhabited by give or six people from the Isle of France, for the purpose of sealing. When we came near the land, fell in with
            various winds and calms–made the river on Sunday about twelve o'clock, and brought up off Hobart, at three P M on Monday. The country has a very fine prospect, a great deal of wood, but
            interspersed with fields all in green, for it is the spring here now–the pease are in full bloom. This town is very irregularly built, just like a Norwegian village–a deal of wooden
            houses–the appearance of the country pleases the eye greatly of the passengers, and the visit they had from the Deputy Governor was very favourable. Governor M'Quarrie is to be here from
            Sidney in the course of a fortnight or three weeks to survey the Government works. The passengers are in great suspense whether they will forward themselves to Sydney, or wait until he
            comes. Butter sells at 4s, a lb ; coarse ship biscuits 35s. a cwt ; a pair of ashets, middle size, 21s. and every thing in like proportion. Salted pork would have sold very well–could
            clear L130 a cwt. Beef is about 6d. a lb. If you buy any here, and pay in produce, you pay more than in hard cash. There are few bush rangers now, they were mostly all shot in the woods.
            No encouragement here for pickpockets. Some of the richest and most powerful men here have once been sent out as convicts, but, from their good behaviour, got their emancipation. The
            Midship Leith, upon the pier, is here ; he is master of a colonial brig trading between Sydney and here. Our passengers tell me they can chuse what land they like ; but not the quality ;
            they must apply the saw and the hatchet a great deal. A hatchet costs 7s. 6d. a lb. Very few people have female servants, as they can't trust them ; as those who come out are convicts, and
            get soon married, so they have all men servants."</p>

         <p>American Papers.</p>
         <p>New York, May 8. The sloop Hero, Capt. Palmer, arrived at Stonington, last Tuesday, in seventy-three days from New South Iceland, with a cargo of oil. ON the 28th of March, in lat. 21. S.
            long. 35. W. spokethe Brig Wilner, of London, from Buenos Ayres, bound to Falmouth, England ; the Captain of which informed Capt. P. that the Chilian army, near Peru, had fought two
            battles with the Royal army, in both of which the Chilian army was victorious ; and it was supposed would cause the surrender of Peru soon to the Chilians.</p>
         <p>May 15. The gigantic projects that occupy the attention of our countrymen are truly surprising. A plan is now forming, for example, to establish a settlement at the mouth of the river
            Columbia, for the purpose of importing teas direct from the East Indies. It is then proposed to transport this article of merchandize up the Columbia, until it reaches the rocky mountains,
            and then to proceed by land to the navigable branch of the Missouri. This embraces a space of three hundred and forty miles in extent. Of this distance 200 miles are represented by
            travellers as constituting an excellent road ; the remaining one hundred and forty comprehend the mountain barrier, which must be passed by the intrepidity and labour of man. The
            merchandize will then, by the aid of the Missouri and its subsidiary streams, supply the whole western continent with the refreshing beverage. This shows the varied changes of commerse ;
            the Atlantic States have heretofore been the medium of supplying our western States with the productions of China ; but if this plan should be carried into effect, we may receive our
            supply from that country through the western States.</p>
         <p>May 16. It is worthy of remark, that among the numerous arrivals at this port yesterday, were three British brigs from Dundee. This makes good the remark of a late Scotch gazette, that
            Dundee was becoming a place of considerable trade.</p>

         <p>Africa. –Extract of a Letter from Capt. Colliver, a Gentlemen belonging to the county of Cornwall, and who is an Officer in the service of the African Comapny:–</p>
         <p>Cape Coast Castle, April 21, 1821. By the time you have received this, it is probable the African Company will have ceased to exist ; we have received orders to hold ourselves in readiness
            to deliver up the Forsts and Settlements here to Government. It is understood they are to be put on the same footing as Sierra Leone. A list has been furnished to Government by the
            Company's Committee, of their Officers, their age, length of service, the situations they fill ; their emoluments[?], &amp;c. We have been blockaded here, since the 10th of February, by
            the Ashantees[?] (an African tribe), who have commenced hostilities against us. On the day before mentioned, our Governor received intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast,
            where the people are under our protection, had been cruelly murdered by a Chief of the Fantes[?], at a place about six miles from Cape Coast, called Moree[?]. I was immediately ordered to
            assemble all the soldiers I could, in five minutes, and proceed to Moree to seize the murderer. I quickly set off with four officers and 85 soliders. A little before we entered the town of
            Moree, where the savages, between 2 and 3,000 in number, were assembled, we saw the mangled remains of their unforunate victim. The town stands near the top of a hill, on the summit of
            which is an old Dutch Fort. As soon as we entered the town, a fire was opened upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the murderer, if possible, without bloodshed, I did not for some time
            allow the men to return the fire. However, perceiving they were resolved to oppose us, I gave directions to my little party to give them a volley and then to charge. The negroes retired as
            we advanced, and in less than an hour we gained the hill, from which our opponents fled in every firection. We demanded the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging to Moree ; who
            not being engaged in the affair had remained, and who immediately gave them up. In the fort, which has a draw-bridge, we were perfectly secure from the attack of the negroes. The body we
            defeated were Fantees, who were assembled to assist the Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands made by them on the people of Cape Coast. As soon as the Ashantees, who reside near
            Cape Coast, learned that the Governor had sent an armed force against their friends, their drum beat to arms, and they hastened after us ; fortunately we had defeated our opponents before
            they arrived. However, they rallied the Fantees, and took a position about half a mile from the town, with a determination to oppose our little party. The Governor, apprised of our
            situation, assembled all the forces he could muster, and speedily about 500 of the Cape Coast people, headed by our officers, and carrying the British flag, were seen approaching. The
            enemy immediatel retired, and we were relieved from our disagreeable situation, after having been from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon exposed to a burning sun, without
            refreshment. The negroes had 47 killed, and upwards of 100 wounded in this affair ; we had one soldier killed, and four wounded. Since the affair, we have not seen one of the Ashantees or
            the Fantees here ; and a total stoppage of trade has taken place. We have not learned how the King of Ashantee intends to act, nor is it safe to venture out of our limits, except in large
            parties.</p>
         <p>New South Shetland –The Lord Melville, J. Clark, master has arrived in the London Docks from the New South Shetland fishery, which he left on the 31st of March, having on board the
            following persons, belogning to the crews of the undermentioned vessels, which had been wrecked, and whom he landed at Buenos Ayres, on the 21st of April, viz.</p>
         <p>From the Hannah, Captain Johnson–J. Knowles (cooper), R. Thompson (joiner), J. Colditch, W. Jones, T. Lewis, H. Pearman, J. Boyd, A. Pringle, R. Richards, and W. Martin.</p>
         <p>From the Minerva, Captain Burn–J. Stephens, R. Pearson, J. Collilice, W. Wisslock, W. Pile, and J. Wallar.</p>
         <p>From the Lady Troubridge, Captain Sherrard–J. Forsham (first mate), D. Humphreys (seaman), J. Wolin, G. Martin, G. Inglefield, M. Swallow, T. Williams, J. Parsonage, W. Rome, W. Dead, J.
            Williams and J. Williams.</p>
         <p>Captain Clark, also carried to Buenos Ayres the crew of the American schooner Venus, Capt. Nappue. He sailed from the River Plate on the 28th of April, and reached the Downs on the 31st
            ult. Capt. Clark left a small colony at Easter Harbour, consisting of the following individuals:–R. Gibbs, of London first officer of the Lord Melville ; G. Robertson, of Hamburgh, second
            officer of the Minerva, a vessel reported lost, but since arrived in the Brazils ; J. Jornan, of Leith, boatswain of the Lord Melville ; P. Howson, of Carron, carpenter ; J. Lockey, of
            Essex ; J. Semple, of Dundee ; J. Ash, of Liverpool ; J. Wares, a Portuguese ; William South of Aberden ; J. Roberts, of Liverpool ; and J. Havers, of Harwich, seamen.–They were left in
            good health and spirits, with a stock of twelve months provisions, and all the materials necessary for erecting three or four houses.</p>

         <p>Alarming Fires in the Woods of Main and New Brunswick.–A gentleman, who arrived here on Thursday, in the schooner Active, from Eastport, informs, that the drought in the neighbourhood of
            St. Croix river, the present season, has been unusually severe, and that the fires in the woods have raged to a more alarming extent than ever before known. Several buildings have been
            burnt at the parish of St. Stephen's on the British side of the river, others were saved with a great difficulty. From Calais to Eastport, about a fortnight since, the vessel in which our
            informant took passage was entirely enveloped in smoke.– In various places, the fires have been burning for six weeks ; there had been no rain for eight weeks to wet the ground.– Boston
            Paper.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter to a Lady in the vicinity of Chelmsford, dated New Essex, Graham's Town, on the frontiers of Africa, June 21, 1821:–</p>
         <p>"I am seven hundred miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and should not receive intelligence of an arrival there for at least three weeks ; but my correspondent at Cape Town will procure
            comfortable lodgings, &amp;c. until a ship sails for Algoa Bay, which is distant from me one hundred and thirty miles.– Few ships from England proceed farther than the Cape. Good ploughmen
            are wanted, and good footploughs, with spare wrought-iron shares and coulters, which are very expensive here ; iron-work nothing under 1s. per lb. Ransome's ploughs sell for 14l. each.
            Ploughmen will find plenty of employers, at from 2l. to 8l. per month and their board. Meat sells at 2d. per lb ; wheat 12s. bushel ; and barley 6s. Other articles of housekeeping are
            about the same price as in England ; but, on the other hand, we are in one of the healthiest climates in the world, and free from rent, tithes, and taxes of every description. Any one may
            live here as well with 500l. as in his native land with 5000l. The farming work is still[?] done with oxen, which are very fine, and bought at 3l. each ; cows are 30s. ; and sheep, 6s.
            a-head (having tails that weight 8lb., a complete lump of fat) ; clothes, linen, and all English goods, very dear.– Good mechanics, of any description, have very high wages. A cargo of
            Ladies would make a good speculation, in proceeding to the New Settlement ; for all that came out with the settlers have got husbands."</p>
         <p>By letters received from the Cape of Good Hope, we understand that the Royal African corps was disbanded there on the 26th of June last.</p>
         <p>By letters from Bombay, dated the 24 of May, we learn that the Governor, the Honourable Mr. Elphinstone, has returned to the Presidency, after a five months' tour to the northward. He must
            minutely examined all the judicial and revenue systems–furnishing the Collectors and Agents of Government with particular instructions for their guidance. He also sent out strong
            detachments to reduce some predatory hordes who have long plundered the country, and been a terror to the peaceable natives. Those plunderers are are called Bheels[?]. They live in the
            hills and woods, and descend in bands to commit their depredations. By these letters we learn, what is essential for young men going out to India to know, that Writers and Cadets now
            undergo an examination as to their knowledge of the native languages ; and no youth has a chance of success who is ignorant of the Hindoustanee[?]. The highest respect is entertained for
            the able manner in which the disinterested Dr. Gilchrist prepares young men for the services. We rejoice to learn that the Cholera Morbus has abated its rigour in the Deccan.</p>
         <p>Batavia journals of the 28th April give an account of a terrible earthquake which took place on the 29th December last, on the south coast of Celebes. It did immense damage, especially at
            Budekomba[?], where the sea rose several times to a prodigious height, and then falling in with the incredible rapidity, alternately deluged and left the shore, destroying all the
            plantations from Bontain to Boelekomba[?]. Many hundred have lost their lives. The fort of Boelekom-[?] ba was much damaged, that of Bontain less so. On the 4th of January this year, there
            was another shock of an earthquake, but we do not learn that it did any damage. It is with much regret we lay before our readers the following details of a most calamitous fire which broke
            out at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 17th ult. :</p>
         <p>" Halifax, Sept. 17. "The conflagration this morning was one of the most awful and destructive every witness in Halifax. It originated in Sackville-street, in the Bakery occupied by Shay
            and Milany, and before it was discovered, had gained an alarming height. It was near two o'clock when the bells were rung. The troops, seamean of his Majesty's ships, and inhabitants, soon
            assembled ; the engines were judiciously placed, lines formed to different reservoirs of water, and every exertion made to extinguish the fire, but we regret to state, that before any
            check could be given to it, the whole block of buildings, with the exception of a house situated at the corner of Sackville and Blowers'-streets, occupied by Mr H. Croskill, the houses
            occupied by Mrs. Neilson and Mr T. Muirhead, on Barringtonstreet, and a stable belonging to J. W. Johnston, Esq. in Granville-street, were consumed.</p>
         <p>"For some time great apprehensions were entertaintained that the fire would extend to the houses on the opposite side of the streets, but fortunately it did not. Of the property burnt only
            about t1500 were insured, and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long be severely felt–upon windows and orphan children– upon industrious tradesmen, whose whole stock of worldly
            wealth was invested in the tenements they occupied.</p>
         <p>"To the troops, and the seamen of the ships of war, the town is, as usual, greatly indebted for the exertions made by them. Twenty-one houses were consumed, with other valuable
            property."</p>
         <p>America appears to be very unhealthy just now– The accounts from Long Island, Baltimore, Amelia Island, and Norfolk, are extremely calamitous. The whole of Amelia Island is a perfect
            hospital, not one family being well, and in many instances not one to assist another. So dreadful, indeed, is the disease, that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New York Paper of
            the 30th ult. says–</p>
         <p>We are sorry to perceive from the Franklin Gazette, that the malignant fever continues to make serious ravages among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four full victims to it in the 24
            hours ending on Sunday morning ; and six during the 24 hours ending Monday morning.</p>

         <p>In our last paper, we gave, from the Jamaiza Gazettes, an account of the dreadful drought which had prevailed in that island for more than twelve months and the consequences of which had
            been most calamitous. We are now, however, most happy, in being able to state, upon the authority of a Gentleman who left Jamaica some days subsequently to the date of our preceding
            advices, that this terible evil, in such a climate particularly, had at length ceased. The following is the substance of the information which has been communicated to us:–</p>
         <p>"A few hours previous to my going on board the Jamaica packet, on the 3d of September, the rain fell in such torrents as to flood the streets of Kingston to the depth of two feet, and it
            seemed to be general throughout the district of Liguanea.</p>
         <p>"Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the present, or, perhaps, the ensuing year, this seasonable change of weather would at least have the effect of staying the mortality among
            the cattle. As such, those interested in the island will receive the intelligence with gratification. On some properties, the canes had been cut as fodder to save the stock."</p>
         <p>We have the Cape of Good Hope papers to the 6th August, and as they are unusually barren in their contents, it is fair to infer that every thing was proceeding there in a satisfactory
            manner. The only article of the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor is gradually effecting in the currency, by removing from it all the base metal, and substituting gold
            and silver of standard value.</p>
         <p>The Gazette of Dordrecht publishes accounts from Java to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of the decrease of the malady, and mention, that it was almost wholly subdued in the
            district of Samarang, but that 18,000 persons, mostly Europeans, had fallen victims. Batavia and Sourabaya were still infected.</p>
         <p>India –Extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated June 20:–</p>
         <p>"If the extension of foreign trading be considered with you as a means suited to alleviate the pressure, and ease the difficulties of Old England, which we read of here, we imagine that
            India can furnish beneficial openings to this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British production and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the English printed cottons are now
            carried in considerable quantities as far as Rajpootha, and find a ready sale, if they be of handsome patterns. The warehouses now are so far from being overstocked, that before the
            arrival of two vessels from England in the last fortnight, all European articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1[?] ; ham, three half crowns the
            ld ; a common round hat, three guineas. These, undoubtedly, were prices arising from an unusual scarcity ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a trading, which admits, even,
            indicidentally, of such an exaggeration of price and profit. Government bonds are now at six per cent premium, though they bear but half the usual or legal interest of the country. This is
            a tolerable evidence of the credit of the Company and the Government. There is a great and increasing prosperity in Hindostan. The augmented cultivation of the Upper Provinces within these
            two years is surprising.</p>

         <p>Emigration.</p>
         <p>The following is an extract of a letter dated Louisville, August 12th, 1820, from a Scotchman who has been long settled in America, to his friend, a Scotch Farmer, who rents 500 acres of
            land in the County of Middlesex.</p>
         <p>"The circumstances in which this country is placed at present are truly melancholy, when compared to what they have been ; yet still it is a better country to live in than Britain. It is
            not easy to make money by farming, at present, in the United States, for the want of a market; and I am of opinion that things will not mend, in this respect, for some years, for all are
            sellers and none buyers. All kinds of produce are selling, or rather offered for sale, at one-third of what prices were two years ago. Land, of course, has fallen in the same ratio. The
            best of cleared land, within from 5 to 10 miles of this town, is offered for them from 10 to 20 dollars an acre. You will thence conclude that this is a favourable time to purchase – and
            that for a man who has a little money, and a large family able and willing to labour with their hands, this is a most excellent country, as he can easily raise on this cheap land all the
            necessaries, and many of the luxuries, of life. He will find it difficult to get gold or silver, or even our own bad bank notes; but a man cannot be badly off with more beef, mutton, pork
            and grain, than he can dispose of. He has no rent to make up by term day: his taxes are next to nothing, and although he may grumble to have to turn his pigs into his corn field to save
            the expense of reaping it, or to see his apples rotting under his trees by barn-fulls because he has not room or use for them, yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those of
            the poor farmers in our native land, and as I suppose in England. To the wealthier farmer the change is not beneficial or desirable. It is true that if he stays long in Britain he will
            soon become less wealthy; yet still he would for some time regret the change. He would miss many things made necessary by habit; he would find his servants more lazy, and less obedient ;
            and he would even experience pain because the modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do here; but when he gets over these things, he will find the advantage of the change. To say
            nothing of the difference of the Government, and the satisfaction of chusing one's own rulers, there are many desirable things here. I estimate, as the greatest, the ease of providing for
            one's family. A man may, with very little exertion, leave to all his children land enough to make them independent. Hence that sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family is little
            known here."</p>

         <p>SOUTH AMERICA. Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, September 10, 1821.</p>
         <p>"Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans, and not as many born in the country;
            the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and miserty than in any town of the size
            in the world.– There are some few splendid houses, but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as in all
            American towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each : the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as if turned out
            of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general, with fever–their habits and
            manner of living increase the evil: thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out
            in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at
            home–they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, and in the squares: not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables: they drink brandy at all hours, and
            excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive, by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the
            evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, and dress; every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady take no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite as
            good as her neighbours, and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America: every Viceroy, from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a
            plunderer, a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it : scarcely a young lady can read or write, or use a
            needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves : as to priestcraft, it
            reigns here in all its glory : a third part of Lima is covered with churches, some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of
            Pasco for returns : if this is worked to advantage, it will produce six millions of produce. Mining may be carried to any extent, it is true; but this requires tranquility and good
            government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas of Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a
            liar.</p>
         <p>"Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to Upper Peru, is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the pepole all
            in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on a bulsa, (two bladders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetables
            for money. Their cultivation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twenty hours, offering them any price for their
            tropical fruits.</p>
         <p>"I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery No such thing as a tavern : never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to
            his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week : the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the chandlier; the house filled
            with smoke.</p>
         <p>"There are 82 titled familes, mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year, Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe;
            indeed the Indians will regain their empire, and exterminate all other colours. The number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– 25,000 in Lima and adjacent
            villages; the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.</p>
         <p>"About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace, the
            produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Jauja an other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is contiued to little
            vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town, half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left
            to starved slaves; such famished objects I never behald; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they will not work, and famine must ensue. "</p>

         <p> Captain Kerr, arrived direct from Port Jackson, New South Wales, which place she left on the 1st of February, not having touched any where, and made her voyage round Cape Horn in four
            months and five days. She has a full cargo of wool and sea oil ; the former principally the produce of the flocks of Mr Macarther, and is much improved in fineness, in better condition for
            market, and is altogether superior to the first class of Spanish wool.–Trade was toletably brisk at all our settlements in that quarter, and the crops had been productive.</p>

         <p>Prison Discipline.</p>
         <p>The Fifth Report of the Committee of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, &amp;c.–1823. With an Appendix, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>T his Report only reached us yesterday ; but the Society brings so much benevolence into activity, under the guidance of practical wisdom, aided by very enlightened views of the best
            interests of society, that we consider any delay improper in calling the attention of the public to their valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds with evidence that they have not
            relaxed in their exertions. At home, not only are the laws improving, but the magistracy are carrying improvements into all the practical departments. A great many jails, designed on much
            better principlpes, are in progress in different parts of the country ; and in those which are used, it may be said, generally, that much more attentions is paid to health, cleanliness,
            diet, employment, and classification. It must not be thought, however, that nothing remains to be done. There are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed, and chained to the floor
            of their cels from night to morning ; others in which persons committed for trial are fettered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ; and others in which debtors are
            exposed to the contaminating society of criminals, in which neither the various classes of prisoners, nor the two sexes, are kept separate from each other, and in which all are allowed to
            be idle. The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a covered vehicle for conveying prisoners to the Sessions'house ; but in the metropolis, it would appear, the practise still continues of
            inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely suspected of crime, by marching them handcuffed through the streets of London ; and, very recently, a party of one hun- dred
            prisoners were marched for a mile handcuffed through the open streets, in order to be formally set at liber- ty by proclamation ! So much for metropolitan decorum ! These shameful
            exhibitions and practises cannot, however, long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them, through the proceedings of the Society should, of itself, be enough to do them away ;
            but while they are continued England should be somewhat chary of her boasts. The views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting notice and gaining ground in France, Switzerland,
            the Netherlands, Hanover, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates have already resolved on the erection of a new city gaol. In St
            Petersburgh the prisoners are now furnished with food, clothing, baths, and medical assistance. A Ladies' Association, under the patronage of the Princess Mesthersky, is also in full
            activity at St Petersburgh ; and there is an auxiliary prison society at Orel, on the very frontiers of Siberia. Seven thousand prisoners passed through Orel last year ; but their chains
            have been lightened, and their condition meliorated generally, through the exertions of the Russian Society. For details, however, we must refer to the Report itself ; but we cannot take
            leave of it without making special notice of the benefits conferred on society by the Female Associations and Temporary Refuge. The almost miraculous power of kindness, when accompanied,
            as genuine kindness often is, with quiet feeling and unobtrusive goodness, continues to be exemplified in the Ladies' Committee, of which Mrs Fry, we believe, is still at the head. In
            Newgate, idleness, dissipation, and licentiousness, have been succeeded by industry, order, and restraint ; and the same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships in which
            convicts are embarked for New South Wales. Arrangements are thus made for the formation of schools for moral and religious instruction during the voyage, and the convicts are furnished not
            only with suitable clothing and other necessaries, but the means of employment in the manufacture of such articles as may be readily sold for their relief on arriving at the colony. These
            are truly good works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have been
            established in Bedford, Bristol, Carlisle, Colchester, Derby, Dumfries, Durham, Exeter, Lancaster, Nottingham, Plymouth, York, and Glasgow. We had once thought that, by this time, we might
            have added Edinburgh ; and we are inclined to hope that the present Lord Provost will yet employ his influence in establishing a Lady's Society for the prisons of our Metropolis.– There,
            too, we had cherished, and still cherish, the hope, of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of the Prison Society is chiefly for affording relief to distressed boys, who, on
            their discharge from the prisons of the metropolis, have expressed a desire to abandon their criminal courses. Many of these are in circumstances of urgent want ; and " the Committee can
            now look round wtih pleasure on many who are variously settled, and conducting them- selves exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are trained up to habits of industry, instructed in
            moral and religious duty, and after a time are provided with suitable situations." There is a great similarity in the histories of the individuals admitted into this asylum ; but the
            greater number, obviously, consists of boys, who had been almost driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or destitution, or who, from neglect or loss of parents, had fallen
            into the company of professed thieves. The Committee mention that on one recent occasion, no less than eight boys were released from Newgate in one day, and immediately after they had
            undergone the sentence of flogging, which, upon some insane rule, is usually carried into effect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus marked with the stigma of guilt, and,
            from soreness and want of strength, they are disabled from working, at the very time they ought to go in search of employment. No more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate
            these boys against society, to prevent them from obtaining employment, though desirous of it, or to impel them to recommence their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to
            look upon what they call a smart whipping as the only corrective for juvenile offences, to reflect a little on the consequences to which their system inevitably tends. We are decidedly,
            and in all cases, against the deliberate infliction of pain, merely to be felt as such. In the case of children, if not necessary for that purpose, it will certainly give them the idea of
            power superior to their own, and may thus be the means of constraining more readily than otherwise ; but the law, when it inflicts pain, has always other means of evincing its power, and
            constraining those who are within its grasp. Its most important function is to prevent crime ; its next is o convince those who comit offences that the means of detection are, on the
            whole, so sure that nothing is to be gained by the commission ; and its next, to make restitution onerous and complete. There may also be some classes of criminals who ought to be
            considered and treated as mad –some are curable ; and some as incurably furious, who must either be cut off altogether, or confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction of
            punishments, because in our opinion the most effectual of those will be found to consist in the best means of preventing or remedying the evils produced by crime. All exposures,
            restraints, constraints, and compulsory reparations are punishments. We are only hostile to the infliction of pain for no other purpose but because pain is produced. If it can be made
            obvious to the sufferers that the pain inflicted protects others, or affords true reparation for the wrongs done to them or society, we shall then grant that such punishments may be both
            just and expedient. The Prison Society, while they vindicate themselves, temperately but firmly, from the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind and irrational benevolence, and
            advocated measures which went to raise the condition of prisoners above that of common labourers, do still seem to us to have been too much moved by the coarse jokes and reckless
            speculations of a clever essayist. If they err at all, they seem now to be somewhat too indulgent to the advocates of hard labour and severe punishments. We are rather inclined to think
            them too decidely in favour of the tread mill, which they allow has been so worked or constructed at different places as to form very unequal measures of punishment, and they very properly
            insist that every tread-mill should be provided with " a regulator," by which its rate of revolution may at all times be restrained within safe limits, and a dial-register, (lately
            invented by Mr Bate, instrumentmaker to the Board of Excise) by which the rate of labour may be, at any time, accurately ascertained, and which ( they think ) should in no case exceed
            12,000 feet in ascent for one day. There is an able argument in the report against compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned for trial : and there is a great mass of curious
            and useful information in the Appendix.</p>

         <p>Total Charge, t7,856 0 11</p>
         <p>In January, 1823, there were 3,031 in the hulks ; 2,138 have been received since ; 1,402 have been sent to New South Wales ; and 300 to Bermuda ; 468 have been discharge by pardon or
            transferred to other establishments ; 3 have escaped ; 43 have died ; and 2,953 remained in the different hulks on 1st Janury last. The health of these prisoners has been good, their
            conduct orderly.</p>
         <p>The Office-bearers of the Refuge for the Destitute have, during the last year, given relief to 424 persons. They have apprenticed to trades, recommended to service or employment, or
            restored to parents and friends, 214 individuals :–under their charge at present 154. Most of the male culprits require to be kept two years at least. The expenditure has been very
            considerable. Mr Peel has recommended a grant from Parliament.</p>
         <p>As we feared, the bill introduced for the purpose of qualifying persons possessed of personal property to serve as juries contains no regulations for the more impartial striking of juries,
            or returning or making up of those who are to serve on each jury. There does seem to be an improvement on the form of the returns to be made by the Constables to the Sheriffs.</p>

         <p>Scottish Intelligence.</p>
         <p>Repeated instances have lately occurred, in whcih dwellinghouses have suffered damage by fire, owing to the carelessnes of servants and others, who, by way of economy, take off fires at
            night and put the burning coals under the grate, not recollecting that, in the construction of almost every house, the stone placed under the grate is supported by timber, separated from
            the hearth stone by some lime only. The wood underneath being once ignited, the fire will rapidly spread, and may in a few hours involve the whole tenement in flames.</p>
         <p>Emigration to Australia. –We understand that the establishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a number of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a society to aid
            deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, and that matters are actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into
            effect. On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall, Niddry Street, which was respectably attended, the Rev. Mr Lothian in the Chair, when a series of resolutions were moved by
            William Ellis, Esq. S. S. C., and seocnd by Robert Paul, Esq. of the Commercial Bank. The principal object comprehended in those were the security of the persons and property of emigrants
            on the voyage–the maintenance of a regular communication with friends left behind, and the insuring a friendly welcome, temporary accommodation, and facilities for permanent settlement in
            the country of their adoption. It was also proposed to give assistance in money to deserving emigrants, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of freight and passage out–every applicant
            being first well recommended, and his character subjected to strict scrutiny. Masons, wrights, smiths, and other artisans, schoolmasters, farm servants, and labourers, are the classes to
            which the principles of the society specially apply.</p>
         <p>According to the opinion of persons largely engaged in the silktrade, the amount of drawback to be allowed on silk that has paid the duty will be between t300,000 and t400,000.</p>
         <p>On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in Tobago Street, and the Police were called, who, to make sure of the rioter, secured the door ; at which a young woman, a servant,
            became so much alarmed, that she leaped out of a window, situated on the third floor, whereby her back was broken. She now lies very ill in the Royal Infirmary.</p>
         <p>The Army –The several Recruiting Parties throughout Great Britain and Ireland having received their instructions, are now actively employed in raising men for the three new Regiments of
            the Line, whose establishments, it is expected, will be in a very short time completed. The Head-quarters of the 97th Regiment are changedfrom Gosport to Winchester.</p>

         <p>Mr Secretary Peel, in moving the commitment of the Transportation Bill, stated, that the objects of the bill were, first, to continue the laws on transportation, that would expire before
            the next session ; and next, to cimplify the law. In the last session a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment of the union of the hulk and transportation system,
            by sending convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to decide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it was satisfactory. It had been hithero
            complained that transportation was a very esqual punishment, and certainly there was a great different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled habits, and with a family, and
            upon a man of no fixed habits, to whom, as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a punishment. He wished it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New South Wales, to send some
            of the convicts to a distant part of the settlement, where the punishment would be more severe. A selection would be made from the convicts, so as to make the punishment efficient against
            those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.– He gave this statement because it was right the public should know that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment.</p>

         <p>Press at Cape of Good Hope</p>
         <p>Mr Greig, after stating the correspondence which took place between him and the Fiscal, which led to the suppression of his journal, gives the following account of his interview with that
            functionary. "On Monday evening, the Fiscal sent a messenger to me, requesting I would call at his house, in Strand-street; I did so ; he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my
            paper, The South African Commercial Advertiser, and said he was instructed to inform me that I had departed from the Prospectus – that it was become obnoxious to the Government, and
            referred more particularly to the last three or four Numbers. I asked him to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable. He then mentioned some leading remarks, which (he said)
            bore upon the Administration of the Colony. He further pointed out as " ob- noxious, " all quotations which had been made from " De Lolne[?], "Blackstone," and " Civil Servant's"work "
            Lacon," and, generally all extracts relative to the Liberty of the Press, observing –" Nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these ; and, as we are not men in this Colony, but merely
            infants," it was, in his opinion, dangerous to insert such matter. He added, also, that it was expected I should, in future, publish no parts of trials, but wait until the whole were
            finished ; and, even then, all scurrilous parts (such as the Memorial of Mr L. Cooke to the Treasury), were to be omitted. That I was further to bound down with two sureties, in the
            penalty of ten thousand rix-dollars, that nothing of the offensive nature pointed out, should appear in any future number ; and, lastly, that I was to take particular care, that the next
            number (18) contained no matter of the description alluded to, nor any notice of Mr Edward's trial. To all this, I replied, that I would give no promise as to what would appear in the next
            or any future number. That I required time to consider what was fitting to be done with regard to the security demanded."</p>
         <p>The Morning Chronicle makes the following remarks on this case :– We cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this description should take place in our Colonies. Uncontrouled power
            produces every day in Europe the worst effects on men of the best dispositions, and the best talents, and the Governors of our conquered Colonies, and New South Wales, are unfortunately
            quite absolute. In Europe the people under absolute Governments have this advantage over the people in our colonies, that men in office are generally selected with some reference to
            abilities and acquirements. But with the exception of the East Indies, the Gonernment of which, with all its faults, generally, we believe, avails itself of talents, our colonies are
            unfortunately considered as mere places of refuge for the relatives of our Aristocracy, of whom nothing can be made in this country. This is what constitutes fitness for a Colonial Office
            ; and so far from being astonished at the disgraceful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies, every person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be
            astonished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial appointment of any value. Of Lord Charles Somerset, the less that is said the better. In fact nothing is more wanted
            than the perusal of a Cape of Good Hope Almanack, to satisfy the British public what sort of personage he is. Would it be believe, that in a country of boundless extent, with only a
            settlement here and there, where the greatest enemies the Colonists have to contend with, are the wild animals, it could possible enter in to the head of any rarional being to introduce
            laws for the preservation of game. One would as soon expect to hear laws in Turkey for the preservation of the plague. Yet it so happens, that a code which would do credit to Sir John
            Shelley himself, guarding against the possible disinction of the game of Africa, occupies a goodly space in the Cape Almanack. After such a specimen of wisdom, all criticism on this
            personage would be thrown away.</p>

            place in the colonies or possessions aforesaid, within the meaning of this act ; and every vessel so excluded, as aforesaid, from the ports of the United States, that shall enter, or

            vessels, for exportation, shall be landed in some port or place, other than any port or place in the above-mentioned colonies or possessions ; and any such vessel that shall sail, or
            attempt to sail, from any port of the United States, without having given bond as aforesaid, shall, with her tackle, apparel, and furniture, together with the article or articles
            aforesaid, laden on board the same, as aforesaid, be forefeited to the United States ; provided always that nothing in this act contained shall be so constructed as to violate any

         <p>Love in a Prison. –We have all heard that "Love rules the court, the camp, the grove" but we have rarely heard that the little god delighted to dwell in prisoned solitude ; true it is and
            of verity, nevertheless, that he seems, if not to have fixed his dwelling in, at least to be a very constant visitor of, our jail. It is not long since a couple, who had imbided the tender
            passion, were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and a like consumnation, most devoutly to be wished for by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken place, did not envious
            bolts and bars intervene, for a petition has been presented by two delinquents of different sexes, both under sentence of transportation, to the Magistrates, praying that they may be
            allowed to marry before setting out for New South Wales. The fond pair never saw each other till inclosed in the same vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth Circuit, for capital
            offences ; yet, in this situation, love–omnipotent love–took the captives captive, and rendered them in its enjoyment, even in their perilous plight, "o'er a' the ills o' life victorious."
            But, alas! " the course of true love never did run smooth;" and no less a personage than the Secretary of State for the Home Department has in this case crossed the path of the hapless
            couple, and doomed them to single blessedness for many a year, by ordering the "fair penitent" to be removed to Penitentiary at Millbank for seven years, instead of transportation for
            fourteen ; leaving the forlorn lover to seek consolation in the charms of some sterling or currency damsel in the land of promise, to which he must now wend his solitary way.– Fife

         <p>House of Commons.–June 19.</p>
         <p>The Speaker took the Chair at a few minutes before four o'clock, and was shortly afterwards summoned by the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, to attend the House of Lords.</p>
         <p>The Speaker stated, on his return, that the Royal Assent had been given by Commission to several public and private bills.</p>
         <p>Mr C. Dundas presented a petition from Newbury, in the county of Berks, praying for the abolition of slavery in the West Indies.</p>
         <p>Mr Planta moved for a new writ for the election of a member to serve in Parliament, in the room of Lord Leveson Gower, who had accepted the office of ChiefSecretary for
            Ireland.–Ordered.</p>
         <p>Ale-House Licensing Bill.</p>
         <p>On the motion of Mr Estcourt, the house resolved itself into a committee on this bill.</p>
         <p>On the clause that no brewer who should himself supply public houses with beer, should be allowed to act or assist as a Magistrate at any meeting or session for the granting of
            licenses,</p>
         <p>Mr Bernal moved that this clause be struck out altogether.</p>
         <p>Mr R. Gordon supported the clause.</p>
         <p>Mr Monck thought this the most valuable clause in the bill, and that it was no infringemnt, but a salutary interference with the jurisdiction of borough magistrates.</p>
         <p>Strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the committee divided, when there were–Ayes 46–Noes 53– Majority against the clause 7.</p>
         <p>Several amendments, verbal and otherwise, were then agreed to, amongst which was the omission of the words " Cinque Ports," thus excluding that class of places from the operation of the
            bill. On the clause being proposed relative to the hours during which public houses should be kept open on Sundays.</p>
         <p>Mr Estcourt said, the original clause was to the effect that public-houses should be closed during the hours of morning and afternoon's divine service, but he thought it would be better
            not to permit publicans to allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service (one o'clock.)</p>
         <p>After a conversation, in which several hon. members participated, the clause was agreed to.</p>
         <p>Several other clauses having been then read and agreed to, the house resumed ; the report was brought up, ordered to be taken into further consideration on Monday next, and printed.</p>
         <p>The Usury Laws.</p>
         <p>Mr P. Thompson moved the second reading of the usury laws amendment bill.</p>
         <p>Mr Davenport said he should oppose the bill, as he considered it to be highly injurious both to the landed and commercial interests. The hon. members moved an amendment, that the bill be
            read a second time that day three months.</p>
         <p>The question on th amendment having been put,</p>
         <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested the propriety of postponing this bill until the next session of parliament. He made this suggestion from no unfriendly feeling towards the bill,
            but merely because this was not, he conceived, the most convenient time to consider it. The subject ought to be fully considered, with a view to get rid of evils that existed, without
            interfering with long-continued prejudices. If the discussion were postponed he would give the subject the best attention in his, ( hear.)</p>
         <p>Mr Heathcote approved of the suggestion of the right hon. gentleman, and wished the discussion on the question to be postponed till the next session of parliament.</p>
         <p>Mr L. Foster thought that, between the total repeal, or the continued existence of the Usury Laws, in their present shape, a middle course might be steered. Of the bill before the house he
            thought that, under the guise of a simple enactment, it covered one of the greatest illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the country, for he was convinced that it would effect as
            complete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as could be proposed. It became necessary, therefore, to consider the probable operation of that repeal upon all the great interest
            of the country. The bill might give relief to few, but would bring injury to many.</p>
         <p>Lord Palmerston thought the house indebted to the hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It might be possible to form a bill better than that of the hon. member, but his bill was
            better than the present law, and as such he should vote for it.</p>
         <p>The gallery was then cleared, and the house divided, when there appeared for the second reading,–Ayes, 52; Noes, 40 : majority in favour of the second reading, 12.</p>
         <p>Voters' Registration Bill.</p>
         <p>Lord Nugent moved the second reading of the voters' registration bill, and said that his object in carrying it through the present stage was, that the bill might be committed pro forma,
            for the purpose of having certain amendment introduced into it. It would then be printed with its amendments, in order that the house and the country might have the opportunity of
            considering its details between this and the next session of Parliament.</p>
         <p>Sir R. Wilson moved, as an amendment, that the bill might be read a second time that day six months.</p>
         <p>Mr H. Gurney seconded the amendment.</p>
         <p>The question was then put on the amendment, which was agreed to, and the bill was ordered to be read a second time this day six months.</p>
         <p>Salmon Fisheries Preservation Bill.</p>
         <p>On the motion of the Chancellor of Exche- quer, the house resolved itself into a committee on the salmon fisheries preservation bill.</p>
         <p>Mr Ferguson proposed the insertion of a clause, exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon fisheries in the River and Bay of Thurso, in the county of Caithness, which are the
            exclusive property of Sir John Sinclair.</p>
         <p>After some conversation the gallery was cleared, and the committee divided, when the clause was lost.</p>
         <p>The bill having passed through the committee, the report was ordered to be received this day.</p>
         <p>The other orders were then disposed of, and the house adjourned at half-past two o'clock.</p>
         <p>Friday, June 20.</p>
         <p>Sir G. Murray took the oaths and his seat, on his re-election for the county of Perth.</p>
         <p>A number of petitions were presented against the continuance of Negreo Slavery.</p>
         <p>Irish Currency.</p>
         <p>Sir G. Hill presented a petition from the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Londonderry, praying that the bill for amending the laws relating to Banks in Ireland might not be allowed to
            make further progress for the present. The petition was laid on the table.</p>
         <p>Sir A. Chichester presented a petition from Belfast, praying a reduction of the duty on coals in Ireland, which was laid upon the table.</p>
         <p>Scotch Gaols' Bill.</p>
         <p>The Lord Advocate, in moving that this bill be read a second time and printed, observed, that it was not his intention to press it further during the present Session. No man could,
            however, deny that the object of the Bill was of great importance, and he proposed, therefore, to have its provisions made generally known throughout the country, in order that it might be
            again presented to the house in as perfect a shape as possible.</p>
         <p>The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to be printed.</p>
         <p>Committee of Supply.</p>
         <p>In the committee of supply, a number of grants of minor importance were agreed to.</p>
         <p>Sir H. Hardinge said, he had another resolution to propose, but it was in which he expected that a reduction would be made next year. It was, that a sum of L283,199, 8s 1d be granted for
            the expenses of the disembodied[?] militia of the united kingdom.</p>
         <p>Mr Spring Rice said, that within the last twelve years there had been two millions and a half expended on this body, and that the subject was one which few gentlemen took the trouble to
            look at. He begged to say a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the staff, which was larger than that of England, was without a private man. Nothing could a more outrageous job
            than that of the milita in Ireland. The colonels kept the whole patronage of the regiment, and kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and friends. The militia might have been of
            service at one time in Ireland ; but since that time the present effective police had been established, and quite superseded it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer this to remain if
            they really wished to be economical, and curtail, if not abolish it.</p>
         <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer begged to assure his hon. friend that he wanted no prompting to make any economical reduction. When, however, a plan for the reduction of the staff was
            ready, and it was in contemplation, it would be laid before Parliament, and he should then be the friend of the definite and limited powers to which he had alluded.</p>
         <p>Mr Hume said, the militia had been defended as though the country were in hourly danger of invasion –as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that were so, he would gladly learn of
            what use were the spies, who cost us L450,000 a-year. We had ambassadors–they were very little better than spies–at an expense of L450,00a-year ; and if their cautious observance were not
            sufficient to save the country from sudden invasion, he knew no better means, and he certainly knew no other advantage which ambassadors and consuls could be of.</p>
         <p>New South Wales Bill–Committee.</p>
         <p>On the order of the day having been read for the house resolving itself into committee on the New South Wales bill.</p>
         <p>Mr Huskisson moved that the Speaker do leave the chair.</p>
         <p>Sir J. Mackintosh said, the object of his present motion, of which he had previously given notice, was, to propose two instruction to the committee on the bill which the right hon.
            gentleman (Mr Huskisson) had introduced–first, to the effect that the committee should recommend the introduction of a clause for the establishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales
            and Van Diemen's Land; and secondly, that it should recommend that a clause be introduced, providing for the election of one-third of the Legislative Council from among persons enjoying an
            income of L100 a year, and having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[?] of three years. The best local authories in favour of his proposition. Among these he might mention
            the names of Governor Hunter, Governor Bligh, Mr Bent, the Judge Advocate, Governor Macquarrie, and his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane, who had gone out to the colony prejudiced against the
            introduction into it of these institutions ; but, after two years careful investigation of the subject, wrote home in Oct. 1825, stating, that there was now no longer any doubt about its
            perfect ripeness for them.–( Hear, hear.)– The partial introduction of English institutions into immediate practise was the only pledge of a real intention on the part of government to
            introduce them more completely in the end. The right hon. gent. concluded by moving that instruction be given to the committee to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the
            colony, and to allow the inhabitants a voice in the legislative councils.</p>
         <p>Mr Huskisson said, in the bill which he had introduced, it was intended to extend the privilege to the government of the country of granting trial by jury in all civil cases. His right
            hon. friend would find, if he examined, that the foundation would be laid of granting the inhabitants of that colony a share in managing their own concerns. At present the legislature
            proposed, by way of a first step, to appoint a legislative committee for the purpose of watching and controuling every measure of the state. All trials should be public, under the
            inspection of a free press, and a population jealous of their rights. They should now be prepared in the course of a few years for the regular introduction of a legislative assembly ; not
            had he any fears when such a change should take place, that it would lead to any political convulsion.</p>
         <p>Mr Hume had every reason to believe, that if, instead of inflicting a military governemtn, they would introduce a portion of representation and the privileges of British subjects into New
            South Wales, it would be the most flourishing of the colonies.</p>
         <p>Mr Horace Twiss said, the knowledge of one fact might obviate the necessity for one at least of the right hon. gent.'s propsitions, namely, that the governor of the colony had the power of
            extending to the colonists the right of trial by jury if he should deem it expedient.</p>
         <p>Sir James Mackintosh here intimated that he should not press his amendments. They were accordingly negatived.</p>
         <p>The house then resolved itself into the Committee when several verbal amendments were proposed and agreed to.</p>
         <p>The bill then went through the committee, and the report, with the amendments, was ordered to be brought up on Monday.</p>
         <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and the house adjourned at half-past two o'clock.</p>

         <p>Bervic. –There has been raised this season on the high lands of the farm of Hallgreen, belonging to Mr Blair, a few acres of Rib-grass, a native plant of New South Wales. It was imported
            to this country two years ago by a man who had served his time in Van Dieman's Land. Its[?] favourite soil seems to be high land or muir country, and is so rapid in growth, that it appears
            not only to choke but to extirpate[?] every weed with which it comes in contact. It is said to be the best plant in the world both for feeding cattle, and for producing mik from cows, of
            the best and richest quality. Were the propiertors and tenants of the Highland country to follow the enterprising conduct of Mr Blair, we would soon see their hills covering with a truly
            useful plant, instead of the useless heath, with at present, even at best, only adorns them.</p>

         <p>House of Commons. – June 4</p>
         <p>Sir J. Mackintosh presented a petition from Mr Charles Buck, complaining that managers of theatres were allowed to perform dramatic pieces without the knowledge or leave of the writer, and
            without any profit to him. The hon. member said that Lord Byron and Mr Millman had made similar complaints, and that every person who had given that subject consideration admitted that
            literary property was not sufficiently protected in this country, and that the decline of dramatic writing was to be attributed to the state of the law.</p>
         <p>Mr G. Lamb thought it a very serious grievance that if a man wrote a tragedy it might be taken by any manager, and performed on the stage, and the writer brought to the miserable condition
            of a damned author nolens volenns. ( A laugh. ) The decline of dramatic writing in this country was to be ascribed to the unprofitable nature of that description of writing, as compared
            with other branches of literature ; and it would be very desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his play like any other description of property, and that no manager should
            perform it without paying the writer, which was the system in France.</p>
         <p>The petition was ordered to be printed.</p>
         <p>Birmingham Petition.</p>
         <p>Mr Brougham rose to present a petition from a very respectable body. It had been agreed to at a numerous meeting of manufacturers, artisans, and other inhabitants of Birmingham, and was
            signed by 8000 persons without solicitation. they contended that the distress which now prevailed, not only had reference to that poorer classes of society, but spread itself over the
            whole system of society. This distress the petitioners ascribed to the tampering that had taken place with the currency. Their opinion was, that too much stress was laid upon the panic
            which had taken place in 1825 ; for, though it was true that a great number of failures had taken place among the bankers, yet it was no less true, that of about 70 bankers who had failed,
            as many as 80[?] had subsequently paid 20s in the pound. If such were the case he was very glad to hear it. The opinion of the petitioners rather was, that the present distress arose from
            the speculations and over-trading which had taken place ; and that such might have been the case topitally[?], there could be no manner of doubt, That a great deal of the distress of the
            nation had arisen from the depreciation of the currency, by which people were now paying taxes at a rate that had never been intended when they were originally imposed, was extremely
            likely ; but whether it operated to the extent that the petitioners described was another question. In the year 1819 he had been one of those who had resisted the imposition of new taxes,
            because he thought that that was the very worst time that Ministers could have chosen for such an object. His opinion, however, had been over-ruled, and the taxes had been increased. That
            the effect of this must be to cripple the industry of the country no man could doubt ; and what he wished was to see a remedy for t ; but the misfortune was, that after making every
            possible retrenchment–by reducing salaries, and dealing in the best possible way with all the payments which the nation had to make–the Dead Weight would still remain round the neck of the
            country, and press it down to the effectual injury of its best interests. How were they to get over the 800 millions of debt, and the 30 or 40 millions of interest annually payable
            thereon? In the latter part of the petition he entirely agreed, and hoped that every thing would be done to give the people as great relief from the pressure of the taxes as might be
            consistent with a due regard to the public credit, and the service of the State ; and so far from treating this remedy lightly, the more he thought that the petitioners were wrong in their
            observations on the tampering of the currency, the more he was inclined to listen to that part of the petition which appeared to him to be founded on truth.</p>
         <p>Mr Bennett was of opinion that the forced restoration of a metallic currency was one of the principal causes of the present distress. The taxes were now paid in money, and it now required
            twice the produce to pay them which it did before the year 1819. That was nothing less than a robbery, but how it was to be remedied he really was at a loss to know. He would never break
            faith with the public creditor, and the only means to pay off our public debt would be to impose an income tax. If the public debt were once removed, then free trade could take place in
            every branch of trade, but not till then. Such was the opinion of his late friend, Mr Ricardo, and sooner or later he thought some such measure would be resorted to.</p>
         <p>Mr Alderman Waitham observed that it was strange that while the public distress was admitted to be extreme, no effort was made to reduce the public expenditure. He was ready to prove that
            the export trade of the country had fallen off to the amount of from nearly nine to thirteen millions, although he knew that in saying this he was encountering serious adversaries. He did
            not under-rate our export trade ; it was valuable but for a period of thirty-one years it had fallen off at the rate of six millions per annum ; and this could be shewn from Parliamentary
            documents. With respect to the petition now before the house, he mainly agreed with its statements, while at the same time he could never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with
            the public creditor.</p>
         <p>Mr W. Whitmore heard with astonishment that our foreign trade had greatly diminished, the reverse being so notoriously the fact. Since 1814 there was certainly a fall in the value of our
            manufactures, but so there was in the raw material, and the vast increase of machinery should also be taken into account. It was said that our exports had declined, but facts would prove
            decidedly the reverse. From 1790 to 1799, the exports were L17,000,000 ; from 1800 to 1809, L,26,000,000; from 1810 to 1819, L36,000,000 ; from 1821 to 1826, L45,000,000 ; in 1827,
            L51,000,000 ; and in 1828 the amounts of exports rose to L52,000,000– So much for the alleged decrease of our export trade, as stated by the worthy Alderman, ( hear, hear, hear. ) In
            1819[?] the currency was in the greatest state of depreciation ; but he begged pardon for having said so much, and he was induced to offer a word in order to counteract the danger which
            might arise if the statements of the worthy Alderman remained unanswered.</p>
         <p>Mr Sec. Peel observed, that, whenever any change, however calculated to be ultimately beneficial, was made in the system of our currency, it must be attended in the first instance with
            considerable inconveniences. The more he considered the subject, the more was he convinced that the best interests of the nation required that we should strictly adhere to the law of our
            currency now established. ( Hear, hear. ) He hoped he should never see the time when the restrictions on cash payments should be renewed. When, however, the petitioners declared it to be
            expedient to increase the amount of our currency by an issue of paper, he would ask them what they would, in that case, do with the Exchanges? If the Exchanges fell, the gold would go out
            of the country. What would they do? They must renew the restriction on cash payments by the Bank. It was not any change in the value of the currency, but the prosperity of Manchester that
            had occasioned the depression in Spitalfields. In 1820, the number of factories in Manchester were fifty-four, and they were assessed at the annual value of L16,816 ; in 1823 they were 56,
            assessed at L18,293 ; in 1826, when the small notes bill passed, the numbers were 72, assessed at L24,034 ; in 1828, the year before the small notes bill took effect, the numbers were 73,
            and they were assessed at L25,245. The hon. gentleman opposite had said that no fresh capital had been employed in this trade, but that persons would work at a loss rather than let their
            machines stand idle. But if this were the case, it would not account for the erection of 12 new factories, the establishment of which was irreconcileable with the idea of general
            stagnation. With respect to the silk trade in Manchester, in 1823 there were 2500 looms, and in 1828 there were 8000 ; and there were between 3 and 4000 looms working manufactured articles
            of silk mixed with cotton. He had had a letter from Manchester, dated 1st of June, upon which he could rely, and it stated that all the silk weavers were, or might be, in active emply. For
            the last ten years at Manchester, machinery had improved in powers of production in the ratio of 10 per cent, per annum. Few persons had attributed enough to the importation of labourers
            from Ireland. A greater number of Irish labourers in the manufacturing districts were out of emply than people could imagine, and the Magistrates relieved them rather than pass them to
            their parishes, reflecting that as they had contributed to the prosperity ot the places, they had a right to relief when in distress. Where the passage was so low, and this country
            possessed the advantage of a legal provision for the poor, it was impossible to check the influx of Irish labourers, and this fact would suggest important alterations in the state of the
            law. ( Hear, hear. ) He felt convinced that any alterations with respect to the values of the currency would be attended with the greatest evils to every class.</p>
         <p>Mr W. Horton observed, that some honourable gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and manufacturers to arise from the state of the currency ; but he (Mr Horton) was at a loss
            to see how the redundant labour at Shipley could have been affected by the change of the currency. Another class were the antipodes of these–they imputed our distress to the corn laws. But
            it was idle to talk of altering the corn laws; we should look to practical remedies. As long as a redundancy of labour existed in England, which was aggravated by the condition of the
            Irish, who flocked to England, and operated a still further prejudice to the labouring class of this country, the distress would continue. The remedy which he proposed for the evil he had
            pointed out was emigration, in the manner proposed in the report of a committee of which he had the honour to be the chairman, by parishes advancing a sum of money to locate pauper
            labourers in our North American colonies. The right hon. gentleman then read opinions in approbation of his plan, from Mr Tooke, Mr Malthus, Colonel Torrens, and others, and observed that
            he had the opinion of the late Mr Ricardo to the same effect, in a lette which had been published. He then entered into a calculation, to show the saving to parishes by this plan, and he
            challenged any member of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations.– There was, however, an answer so easy, that it was constantly made–" The vacuum would be filled up
            immediately." This was a delicate subject to touch upon, for he knew not how the vacuum could be filled up but by the introduction of young gentlemen and ladies. ( A laugh.) But was it
            supposed that fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty children? Or did these objectors suppose that labourers would be brought from Russia or elsewhere ? The right
            honourable gentleman then adverted to the remarks in Mr Sadler's work, wherein it was stated that is appeared from the official documents that the mortality amongst the emigrants to North
            America had been in the unprecedented proportion of 4 in 14, whereas, in Wales, the proportion was 1 in 69, and in England, 1 in 57. This, he would assert, was an incorrect statement. So
            far from the proportion being 1 in 14, it was only 1 in 40, the same proportion which existed in Carlisle, the healthiest place in England. The emigrants, it should be recollected, carried
            out children, and the mortality amongst children was in the proportion of 1 in 12, and in London much greater ; for it had been ascertained that out of 1,000 infants amongst the poor, only
            542 survived the period of nursing. The right hon. gentleman concluded with reading his last resolution–" That it is expedient that such measures should be adopted in the next Session of
            Parliament as may furnish the most safe and effectual means of producing the desird improvement, by a judicious application of both these principles, and at the same time under conditions
            which will prevent the probability of a recurrence of similar evils, and also effect a material saving of the national income, instead of producing an increased charge thereon."</p>
         <p>Mr Huskisson contended that colonization ought to be encouraged. Had it not been for emigration, this country could never have reached its present state of importance and prosperity, nor
            would our language have been extended to the United States, and been adopted in more distant countries. If there were one circumstance more striking than another, it was the prodigious
            increase of consumption, a proof of the growing wealth and resources of the country. In the year 1814, the exchange in trade was against us ; now it was in our favour. This country would
            carry on its great affairs with as small a portion of metallic currency as possible, but let them guard against a system which had led to depreciation of the currency, and the panic which
            was felt in 1825. He had heard somewhere a metaphor respecting paper currency. Like a skyrocket, it rose with splendour, but lost its brightness, and when its fire was extinguished it fell
            in darkness, like the shaft of the rocket, upon the heads of those who had raised it.</p>
         <p>Mr Secretary Peel said, in consequence of the course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to adopt in the previous Session, a series of unfounded calumnies had been levelled at him,
            which, however, he had despised too much to condescend to notice. But there was one which, as it reflected on his public and official character, he would, with permission of the house,
            allude to on that occasion. The report to which he alluded was, that he had used his influence as Secretary of State to procure an enormous grant of land for a relative of his. ( Hear,
            hear, hear. ) In consequence of seeing this report in the public newspapers, he had requested his right honourable friend to move in that house, for the production of certain papers
            calculted to explain the whole matter. Those papers had in consequence been produced, and were now printed ; he trusted, however, that the house would excuse him for again alluding to the
            subject. ( Hear, hear, hear. ) He hoped that the consequence of those papers being printed would have been, that some member would have asked some questions on the subject ; but though
            this was not the case, he had received a communication which made him think that some one out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny, though no member of that house had been so
            deceived, ( cheering.) He begged in the first place, to state most distinctly that he had procured no grant of land for any brother of his, ( hear ) A gentleman, whose name was the same as
            his, and who was his second cousin, had had a grant made him by his right hon. friend ; but in that grant he begged to state to the house, upon his word of honour, as a gentleman, he had
            had no participation whatever, ( hear.) With respect to the settlement on the Swan River, he was ashamed to say that he had neither heard nor knew of it, till he received a letter from his
            cousin, announcing to him that he had abandoned the idea of going to New South Wales ; and that from the circumstances of Mr Twiss informing him that government would be disposed to afford
            assistance to any settlers going to the Swan River, he and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in a proposal to that effect. With respect to the other calumnies which had been
            promulgated against him, they rather went to private matters, and he had therefore not condescended to notice them ; but as this one had reference to the public department in which he
            officiated, he had thought it so far a public concern, as to venture to ask the attention of the house while he trespassed on it to disclaim any participation in the grant that had been
            made, ( hear..</p>
         <p>Sir Geo. Murray –The house would probably think, after the statement of his right honourable friend, that it would be unnecessary for him to rise to address them, ( hear.) He was satisfied
            that the house knew that his right hon. friend was incapable of proposing anything that would come under the designation of what was vulgarly called a job, ( hear.)</p>
         <p>Adjournment.</p>
         <p>Mr Secretary Peel gave notice that he should tomorrow move the adjournment of the house to that day week. The right hon. gentleman at the same time presented a petition from the
            Apothecaries Company of London, in favour, as we understood, of the bill regarding dissection.</p>
         <p>Mr Wilmot Horton rose to propose the resolutions of wich he had given notic relative to the state of the labouring poor.</p>
         <p>The firt resolution having been put from the chair,</p>
         <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer moved as an amendment that the order of the day be now read.</p>
         <p>Mr Bennett opposed the resolutions.</p>
         <p>The amendement was agreed to without a division.</p>
         <p>Mr Labouchere postponed until to-morrow his motion respecting Canada.</p>
         <p>Slave Trade.</p>
         <p>Mr Otway Cave moved the following resolutions:</p>
         <p>"Resolved, 1st. That no human legislature has any lawful power to abridge or destroy the natural rights of life and liberty, unless the owner shall himself commit some criminal act that
            amounts to a forfeiture.</p>
         <p>"2d, That although neither the government nor the legislature of the county have arrogated to themselves the power of destroying the natural rights of innocent British subjects, or of
            delegating any such power to other authorities, it is a notorious fact, that in many British Colonies lying remote from the immediate observation of the Government, innocent British born
            subjects are, from the time of their birth, robbed of their natural rights, and converted into slaves.</p>
         <p>"3. That it is the especial duty of this House, as the Representatives of the people, to take effectual measures for protecting all British subjects that shall be born henceforward in the
            West Indian Colonies, from similar violations of their natural, inherent, and paramount rights as human beings."</p>
         <p>The motion being seconded by Mr Lumley,</p>
         <p>Mr W. Smith said, he could not give his support to these resolutions, because they were connected with a question of too much importance to be agitated in such a manner, and at such a
            period of the Session.</p>
         <p>Mr Huskisson was of opinion that resolutions of such a description as those brought forward by the hon. member, ought to be met by a direct negative.</p>
         <p>Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. The resolutions were declared to be negatived without a division.</p>
         <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and the house adjourned at half-past one o'clock.</p>

         <p>Swan River. –The fine ship Gilmore, purchased by Mr T. Peel, brother to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, proceeded down the river on Saturday, on her voyage to Swan River.
            The Gilmore quitted the St Catherine Docks in the course of Friday, having on board an excellent assortment of every requisite which may be required to form the new settlement. Mr Thomas
            Peel has had the Gilmore, which is of 500 tons burthen, under his own inspection, as well as the selection of the agricultural and other implements to convey to the Swan River. There were
            many passengers on board. Mr Peel and his family, it is understood will join the vessel at Plymouth. In the vessel there are also going out other settlers. The Hooghly, another ship of 500
            tons burthen, chartered by the same individual, is not yet quite ready for her voyage. Among the valuables sent out to Swan River are some fine race-horses, intended for breeding in the
            settlement, from whence India will be supplied, should the settlement answer.– Sunday Times.</p>

         <p>London, Saturday, August 15, 1829</p>
         <p>The King. –We are happy to learn from a private source of unquestionable authenticity, that the King has seldom, if ever, in his whole life, enjoyed better health than at the present
            moment. From the same quarter we have received a confirmation of what we mentioned some time back, that according to the present arrangements of the Court, it is certainly his Majesty's
            intetion to visit Brighton before the expiration of the year.– Brighton Gazette.</p>
         <p>The Revenne. –Ever since the beginning of the quarter, symptoms of progressive improvement have manifested themselves in the revenue. Of late they have assumed a more decided and promising
            character, and if the seven weeks that remain prove as productive as the first month has been, not only will thre be no falling off at the close, but a considerable increase may
            confidently be anticipated. We understand that the general return of duties paid at Custom-house in the port of London, for the month o July last, amounts to one million one hundred and
            ten thousand pounds. The returns from the out-ports have not all yet been received, but, on a fair calculation, it is supposed that they will amount to above one million sterling.–
            Courier.</p>
         <p>It is certainly true that Laurent made an offer of L8000 a year for Covent Garden ; but when asked to put his offer into writing, he withdrew, and nothing more has been heard of it.– Court
            Journal.</p>
         <p>The new musical entertainment forthcoming at the English Opera House, to be called The Spring Lock, is founded upon one of the fictions of an early Italian novelist (Lasca), the incidents
            of which almost include the romatic and eventful interest of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. Peake is the accredited author–Keeley is to be the hero, and Wood the principal vocalist ;
            G. H. Rodwell is the composer.</p>
         <p>It is stated in a recent French paper, that during the last eight months not fewer than twenty political and literary journals have been started in the French provinces.</p>
         <p>It is stated in a French newspaper than an inhabitant of Lyon grafted upon the same stem red and white grapes, and peaches, and apricots, which all flowered at the same time, and gave ripe
            fruit with a few days of each other.</p>
         <p>A carriage, containing 60 persons, was this day seen to traverse Paris. It was drawn by six horses, merely by way of trial. This carriage and several similat ones are building in the
            square of St Salpier. They are to run between Paris and Lyons.– Paris Paper.</p>
         <p>Steam Navigation. –Information has reached the India House, that the East India Company's steamvessel Enterprise will leave Bombay on the 15th of November next, for Suez, where she may be
            expected to arrive early in December. Another steam-vessel is to leave Bombay for the same destination in January next. A communication by steam between this country and the Mediterrarean
            has already been opened, and might, we suppose, be easily extended to Egpyt. The expense of such a speculation would probably be amply compensated by the profit of conveying by so
            desirable a route passengers to and from the East Indies.</p>
         <p>His Majesy the King of Prussia has honoured Mr by presenting him with a splendid gold snuffbox, as a token of his Majesty's approbation of Belshazzar's Feast." the "Dalage."&amp;c. Swan
            River. –That beautiful ship, the Gilmour, sailed on Monday evening for the Swan River. She has upwards of 200 passengers on board, the whole of whom are highly respectable, and many of
            them are in opulent circumstances. When Mr Peel came alongside (accompanied by Mr Soltau), just before the ship got under weigh, the passengers and crew gave him three cheers, and his
            reception altogether was of the most gratifying description. The property on board the Gilmore alone amounts to the more than L60,000. We understand also, that the Minstrel will call at
            this port in about a fortnight to take out other settlers on account of Mr Peel. We are informed that Government have increased Mr Peel's grant of land from 350,000 to 1,000,000 acres.–
            Plymouth Journal.</p>
         <p>Gurney's Steam Carriage. –Yesterday afternoon Mr Gurney's steam carriage was exhibited, at the request of the Duke of Wellington, in the Houslow Barrack yard, before his Grave, the Ladies
            Percy, Dance, and Murray ; Lords Fitzroy Somerset, Rosslyn, and Thomas Cecil ; Lieut. General Sir W. Gordon, QuarterMaster General ; Sir George Murray, Sir Charles Dance, and a large
            number of military and scientific gentlemen. His Grace, Sir W. Gordon, the Ladies Percy, &amp;c. had a carriage attacked, and rode round the yard with the greatest pleasure and
            satisfaction. Afterwards a waggon was fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 soldiers besides Mr Gurney and two or three men on the engine, and though the road was very
            disadvantageous, being a rough loose sand and gravel, it drew them round without the least diminuition of its speed, between nine and ten miles an hour. In these experiments Mr Gurney
            applied his steam generally but to one wheel in order to give the company full proof of the power and practicability of the invention. Having satisfied them as to this, and as to its
            manageability, by a variety of involutions and evolutions, he gave them a specimen of its speed, and drove seven or eight times round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is difficult
            to say whether the company was more pleased or surprised at these unequivocal proofs of Mr Gurney's success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it was scarcely possible to calculate the
            benefits we should derive from the introduction of such an invention as this.</p>
         <p>The French papers of Tuesday state that the Emperor Nicholas was preparing to make a new levy at the rate of 4 upon every 500 male individuals, which would give about 160,000 fresh
            soldiers. He is said, however, to have deferred promulgating the ukase until he should have ascertained that the Porte had definitely rejected the terms of peace which he had proposed. On
            the other hand, we are told that the Sultan has rejected those terms, and that, notwithstanding the successes gained by the Russians, he was resolved to run all the chances of a desperate
            struggle rather than submit to conditions which he deemed insulting.</p>
         <p>The English Bench. –There are two vacancies at present on the judicial Bench ;–one occasioned by the death of Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more recent decease of Mr Charles Warren,
            Chief Justice of Chester, who expired at his house in Bedford Square, on Wednesday afternoon, in the 66th year of his age. Mr Campbell is spoken of as the successor of the former ; and the
            choise, we supposem will be generally deemed to be a proper one. With respect to the Chief Justiceship of Chester, an evening paer, the Sun, very properly recalls to public recollection
            the fact, that "the Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended in their report, the abolition of the Welsh judgeships altogether;" and adds an opinion, in which we perfectly coincide,
            tht " the present seems a fair opportunity for carrying the recommendation into effect." Indeed, in our mind, every opportunity is a fair one for reducing public expences, when public
            burdens are oppressive.</p>
         <p>Platina Coin. –We have seen a specimen of the new Russian platina coinage. The coin is about the size of a shilling, but heavier than a sovereign, and of three roubles value. On one side
            are the Russian eagle and imperial arms; on the other the value of the coin, and date– Globe.</p>
         <p>Ugly Wives Fittest for Poets. –The spouses of the living British poets are well known to be among the plainest of the sect, as Mr Slinslop would say.–is wedded to the head of a gorgon, – –
            is not much better off, – – has eloped from his mate. We might run through the whole catalogue, without discovering a handsome woman, yet none have exceleed these writers in descriptions
            of female beauty. The truth is, that the contemplation of a bottle or peaked nose, a wide mouth, goggle eyes, and a spare body, causes an author to set out with more enthusiasm in search
            of the ideal of womanly perfections, and affords the widest scope to the imagination. Nothing impedes the fancy more domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and divine face ; in which
            case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes the poet's diligence, and he ceases impotently to describe what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not copied from Mrs Milton grilling his dinner at
            the kitchen fire–but from some unattainable damsel of his fancy. Plurality of women is only allowed to a poet– one lawful, plain, household wife–and as many airy mistresses as he can
            embody.</p>

         <p>Swan River. –The ship Warrior, Stone, commander, bound to Swan River, Sydney, and the East Indies, sailed for her destination on Friday, from Portsmouth, with prospects of favourable
            weather in her progress down the Channel. The Warrior is a fine vessel of about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of 250 passengers to the new settlement. Several of the passengers
            are persons of independent fortune, who have embarked considerable property in the speculation ; and and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the enormous sum of L1,000 for the best
            accommodation the vessel could afford their families and suite. Six pianos are on board the Warrior, and a proportionate number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians of course
            accompany the instruments to their destination. The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the choicest breed, several pens of sheep, considerable number of swine, two milch cows, and
            three valuable horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be anticipated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, apprehensions are entertained that a portion of the live cargo must be
            consigned to the ocean before the termination of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the advantageous arrangements entered into by the commander and a gentleman named Semple, who has
            chartered the Warrior, and gone out in her, they will clear the enormous sum of L10,000 by the voyage.</p>

         <p>The King's Health.</p>
         <p>It will be seen from our private letter, that unfavourable accounts respecting his Majesty's health were circulating in London at 7 o'clock on Wednesday evening. In our last we alluded to
            the suspicions which the non-appearance of bulletins for four days after the first, gave rise to. On Monday a second bulletin appeared, certainly not of a character to remove the public
            anxiety, and this has been followed by two days' silence. Every one naturally puts the question, "If his Majesty is better, why not state this in a bulletin, that the thousand discouraging
            rumours in circulation may be put to rest?" The Morning Chronicle says, that the high officers of State are not much better informed on the subject than others, and that a knowledge of his
            Majesty's real condition is confined to the very few immediately around his person. In the absence of correct information, inferences are drawn from every passing circumstance. It was
            observed that Sir Henry Halford very shortly after his return from Windsor on Tuesday morning had a long interview with the Duke of Wellington ; and it has not escaped notice, that his
            Majesty's sister, the Duchess of Gloucester, had been sent for to visit him. The Globe says, that according to reports which are circulated in high quarters, his Majesty's illness excites
            considerable alarm, and that gout in the stomach is complicated with dropsical symptoms. What credit may be due to these statements, we cannot tell; but whether they be true or false, they
            furnish a reason for the publication of official intelligence. The King's health is a matter which concerns the public deeply, and all mystery and deception on the subject are most
            reprehensible. We refer to our London head for a variety of articles upon the subject ; and if this night's mail bring any additional information of importance we shall publish it in a
            secoond edition.</p>
         <p>The two Houses of Parliament meet again on Monday.</p>
         <p>We publish the address of the Birmingham Union to day, and meant to accompany it with some remarks, but have only time at present to express out regret that so masterly a paper, dealing in
            great and immutable principles, should have its value lessened by being so much mixed up with ephemeral matters, and with false or questionable doctrines respecting currency.</p>
         <p>The passion for emigrating to Swan River has not received any check. There are four ships now at London, and as many more at other ports, which are preparing to sail for the settlement
            with passengers. Indeed the numbers who are flying from the country at this moment who are, we believe, quite unprecedented. Within the last ten days we have seen notices of fifteen ships
            that were loading with emigrants at Hull, twelve at Waterford, and several at Bristol, Liverpool, and Greenock, all destined, we think, for the United States, or British America. The
            exportation of human beings from the British Isles, to different quarters of the world, must now be proceeding at the rate of one or two thousand per week.</p>
         <p>It will be remembered, that according to reports from India received some time ago, Lord William Bentick had issued an order, abolishing those horrid human sacrifices, the Suttees. Doubts
            were thrown upon this intelligence when the subject was lately talked of in Parliament ; but we are happy to say, that its accuracy is confirmed by the arrival of the official document. It
            is disgraceful to the British Indian Government, that it has been hitherto either so callous, that it overlooked this enormity, or so ignorant of its own resources, and the true state of
            the people under its authority, as to believe that it had not power to effect its abolition.</p>
         <p>The report of a revolution having taken place in Chili, is confirmed in letters from Bogota. The constitutional Director, Pinto, has been driven out of the capital by General Prieto with
            an armed force, and great excesses are said to have been committed.</p>
         <p>A small fleet sailed lately from Cadiz for Havannah, with 2000 soldiers on board. The expedition is supposed by some to be intended for the invasion of Mexico ; but it is more likely to
            find employment in keeping down the elements of insurrection in Cuba– The plot to which we alluded in our last, seems to have excited much alarm. Some of the most opulent families in the
            island, with several lawyers and official persons, were concerned in it. Their object was, as we conjectured, to convert the island into an independent republic.</p>
         <p>From a detailed list published in the French papers, it appears that the expedition against Algiers is to be composed of 34,000 men, infantry, cavalray, and artillery.</p>
         <p>Farther intelligence has been received from the capital of Colombia to the 14th of February. A warm address had been presented by the Congress to Bolivar, entreating him not to abandon the
            republic at a moment when its existence was menaced by conspiracies; and he seems to have once more consented to remain in office. Commissioners had been appointed to proceed to Valentia,
            and endeavour to accomodate the differences between the people of Venezuela and the central government, by peaceable means. If these failed it was determined to employ force. The Congress
            was in session at Bogota, and was proceeding to fulfil the object for which it had been assembled, by drawing up a new constitution. The bases are published, and though the present only an
            imperfect sketch of its plan, they disclose one or two features which seem to be characteristic. The government is to be central, as it has hitherto been, not federal like that of the
            United States, which has served as a model to Mexico, Guatemala, and La Plata. In the one case the supreme authority is vested in a single legislature, which meets in the capital ; in the
            other it is divided among a number of local assemblies, while the general congress representing the whole, wields no other powers than what is necessary to hold the separate members in a
            state of union. The federal system, which leaves to every province the management of its own concerns, has advantages for a settled and enlightened community ; but whether it is equally
            adapted to the circumstances of an ignorant people newly escaped from political convulsions, is very questionable. There seems, however, to be a partiality for the federal system in the
            new world ; and to humour this feeling, the new constitution provides, that "Chambers of Districts" shall be established, with powers to decide on all municipal and local affairs. The
            difficulty will be, to give these bodies the powers necessary to develope the industry and resources of the country, without permitting them to impose taxes, and exercise other legislative
            functions, which will interfere with the business of the general government. Another articl state, that the members of the Senate and House of Representatives are to hold their seats for a
            considerable time, in order " to avoid the inconveniences resulting from frequent changes, or the repeated election of the same person." In the mouth of an English statesman, we should
            consider this vile sophistry ; but allowance must be made for the res dur? novitas regni, in a new state like Colombia, formed of heterogenous elements, among which it is not easy to
            establish any principle of cohesion. One the same grouns, the Columbian legislators may be pardoned for resolving that the Catholic religion is that of the state, and that no other shall
            be permitted. This is merely a concescession for the sake of peace, to prejudice which the government is not strong enough to subdue, and cannot defy without great danger. Nothing is said
            about the mode of election, or the power of the President, two points of vital consequence, which may give a new complexion to the whole scheme. We have made these remarks on the proposed
            constitution, because it probably holds out the last chance of composing the trouble of Columbia. If it does not satisfy the people other provinces will soon follow the example of
            Venezuela, and all the address and influence of Bolivar will not prevent the republic from splitting into four or five independent communities, whose mutual jealousness and wars will crush
            the librties, and destroy the prosperity of the whole.</p>
         <p>Private Correspondence. London, Wednesday Evening. The King's Health</p>
         <p>We are sorry to state that the private accounts received from Windsor this afternoon, do not speak so favourably of his Majesty's health as the Court Circular, and most of the assertions
            of the papers published this afternoon. There having, however, been no bulletin issued up to the present hour (7 o'clock) must</p>

            cargo are eleven wooden houses, built here, and consisting of four to ten rooms, which have been taken to pieces and will be easily put up again, all the pieces being marked. It is
            probable that many similar cargoes will follow, as timber and labour are so cheap in this country.</p>

         <p>The Wool Trade.–London, Thursday Night.– This afternoon the first sale of wools for a long time past took place at Garraway's Coffee-house. The quantity announced for sale to-day was
            nearly 200 bales, consisting of about 100 bales of New South Wales wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &amp;c. The New South Wales wool was first put up and went off very briskly at
            prices averaging from 1s 4 1/2d to 1s 10d per lb., which quotations are higher than those last obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold by order of the Van Dieman's Land Company,
            being a portion of the last arrivals from the Company's flocks. They met a very ready sale, and the average prices obtained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals from Germany and
            other places this year are expected to be very great.</p>

         <p>THE EQUALITY OF SEXES.–The Examiner of Saturday las has some witty remarks on the plaint which appeared in our paper on the excess of females over males in the census, which he assures us
            is entirely owing to the lives of females being prolonged by their better regularity. This is a sly censure upon the habit of our countrymen, one-fifth, or sixth part of whom we were
            supposed by implication to be cut off permanently by intemperance! We admit that a few hearty fellows do go off in apoplexy; but we deny that the number bears any proportion to the amount
            supposed; we have two other remarks to make on his statement. First, since our manners were corrupted by imitating English fashions, it is whispered, we hope un, that there are such things
            as tippling women in country, some of whom do disappear suddenly–no matter how; and secondly, we wish our London friend inform us how it happens, that while all Broad England has only an
            excess of 11 1/2 per cent females, Edinburgh should have no less than 24! We understand that since this astounding fact was brought out, there has been a great efflux of ladies from the
            city to the adjoining counties. We know a number who have or are flying to Fife and the north. A friend, who careful observer, compares it to the dispersion of the Jews. The ladies, he
            says, attribute their flight to Cholera Maribus!</p>

         <p>The Machine Breakers. –A convict ship at Portsmouth is on the point of sailing for Van Diemen's Land, with between two and three hundred convicts on board, who have been lately convicted
            for machinebreaking, extorting money, and other offences committed in the disturbed counties. Another ship, with convicts of the same description, will be dispatched for New South Wales,
            in about a fortnight. These convicts have been kept entirely separate from all other prisoners, and an accurate report will be made to the Governors of the Colonies, as to their former
            character, their trades and employments, and the recommendations which have been made in their favour subsequently to their trials. The capital convicts whose lives have been spared, are
            to be transported for life; and the convicts, sentenced and recommended by the Judges for transportation, are to be transported according to their respective sentences.</p>

         <p>Mr Hume differed from the view taken of the subject by the right hon. baronet. He was of opinion that it was the duty of Government to give commutation allowance to pensioners anxious to
            emigrate either to New South Wales or to Canada. He could not forebear complaining of the large increase of pensions which had taken place since the year 1814. It was impossible to doubt
            that much misconduct had existed somewhere.</p>

         <p>The Penal Colonies.</p>
         <p>Botany Bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose reformation is hopeless, and whom it is therefore desirable to remove from the Society to whose peace and security they are sworn
            enemies. This is the sole value of the colony. If it did not exist, recourse would be had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the gibbet. Experience shews, however, that
            transportation does not produce the intended effect of terrifying the guilty. Its monitory operation depends greatly on the situation of the criminal. "Agricultural labourers with families
            dread it extremely, while to single men, mechanics who are sure of receiving high wages, and generally to all those who feel a desire of change, and a vague expectation of pushing their
            fortunes, it appears to hold out no terrors whatever." In the colony there is a competition among settlers to obtain convinct servants, and those who get them, endeavour, from a regard to
            their own interest to render the situation of the convicts as little irksome as possible. The evidence proves, that when the feeling degradation is once overcome, the situation of the
            Australian convict "is, in many respects, preferable to that of the agricultural labourer in this country :" He has better clothing, more abundant food, and enjoys a finer climate. The
            hardship, too, of compulsory labour is but for a limited time. The convict who is transported for 7 years, is allowed a Ticket of Leave, at the end of 8years. Once possessed of this ticket
            he is allowed to work on his own account, and with high wages, easily acquires capital. The committee see little chance of rendering punishment effective in the colony. They recommend
            various subordinate regulations, and among others, they suggest as a remedy for the great expense attending transportation, that no convict be assigned to a settler until he shall have
            paid, or given security for the payment by instalments, of the expense incurred in the conveyance of the convict from the mother country.</p>
         <p>We are satisfied that the true check to the increase of crime is to be found, first, in the diffusion of education and sound knowledge ; and, second, in the improvement of our judicial and
            municipal institutions. Law, in all its important branches, should be dispensed by paid and responsible persons. A judge ought to be stationed in each small district, and keep open court
            every day of the year. He should be chosen by some popular constituency, which would faithfully represent the feelings of the mass of suitors; and as a guarantee for his diligence, he
            should hold his office only for seven years, and be re-eligible. Justices of Peace, if retained at all, should be elected as in most of the American states, by the householders for three,
            four, or seven years. Jails also, should be placed under the controul of popular bodies, and thrown open to the improving efforts of private benevolence. In this, as in other points, we
            have much to learn from the Americans, who never forget that the criminal is still a man. The grand defect in our legislation has been, that the rich made laws for the poor, of whose
            situation they had scarcely any knowledge, and with whose feelings, wants, and moral condition, they had of course no sympathy. The unpaid Magistracy of Britain is a barbarism belonging to
            the tenth century. Thirty years hence men will wonder how their forefathers tolerated so monstrous a system.</p>

         <p>Trade</p>
         <p>Wool –The accounts received in Lond from New South Wales to the 8th of January, state that the produce of the last year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest than that of the
            preceding year, and the the quality has also considerably improved. From Van Dieman's Land it is now ascertained that the supply this year will be short, but the general quality is very
            superior. In the course of about a week or ten days, large arrivals of wool are looked for from New South Wales and the private contract business is expected to be very active. The public
            sales of wools went off on Friday very well, and at full prices. The arrivals of this week have consisted of about 708 bales, of which about 292 bales were Van Dieman's Land wools, and the
            rest German. There is a steady demand, and as it is understood that the manufacturers are short of stock, the anticipations are that trade will son be greatly improved.</p>
         <p>York Wool Market, May 23.–The market commenced here for this season this day, with only a small show of wool, and not many buyers. The holders asking very high prices caused part to be
            left unsold. The following are the prices ; Hogs from 18s to 19s ; Hogs and Ewes 16s 6d to 17s 6d ; Locks 11s to 12s, 6d per stone of 16lbs.</p>
         <p>Bradford Market –The supply of Merinos in the markets on Thursday evening, was by no means equal to the demand–all qualities in six quarter wide Merinoes were eagerly bought up, and in
            some instances a farther advance was obtained ; three quarter wide Merinoes run much in demand, but a very scanty supply ; the advance on six quarter wide Merinoes is from 4s to 6s per
            piece, compared with what was given at the beginning of the year, and three quarter wide are proportionably higher. Unless a reduction takes place in the price of wool, the manufacturers
            state they must have a further advance.</p>
         <p>Rochdale Flannel Market. –The market today was very lively for this season of the yar ; low goods both for white and for dyeing were of very ready sale, and in some instances a little
            advance was obtained ; several sales were effected in fine qualities, and if the demand proves permanent, the prospect for the coming season is very promising.</p>
         <p>Liverpool Cotton Market. –There has been but a limited inquiry for cotton during the week ; the sales are only about 10,000 bugs, at declining prices.</p>

         <p>The Wool Trade. –The whole of the London public sales of Colonial and other woold having now been gone through, the wool trade is in a more settled state, and transactions by private
            contract are conducted on a more extensive scale. The total amount of the late sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday, was 4,000 bales, and the colonial wools were taken by the
            manufactures at the extreme advance realized at the previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed, quotations from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. The sales on Saturday was most
            fully attended, and increased boldness was observed. The colonial wools offered on that day fetched excellent prices. Some few bales were also offered, forming a part of the second clip of
            wools in the new colony on the Swan River. They were much better in quality than those last received. Some German lambs' wool also commanded attention, and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per
            lb. The sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not quite so fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according to quality, full prices were obtained. The sale consisted of 437
            bales New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and 72 bales of Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. The best fleece of Amsterdam offered
            fetched 2s 10d to 3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d per lb ; the best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d to 2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van Diemen's
            Land 1s 8d to 1s 10d ; and the best German 2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales is to establish a much firmer market for wools of all descriptions than previously existed. The
            arrivals of wool are limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, and abotu 375 bales of Neapolitan wool have been entered at the custom house.</p>

         <p>Emigration</p>
         <p>T he subject of emigration is rising in importance from year to year, and cannot lose its interest as long as much misery or much discontent exists among our working classes. Upper Canada,
            the great recipient of our surplus population, is 4000 miles from Britain, a distance which looks extremely formidable ; but such is the amazing economy of water carriage, when seconded by
            good arrangements, that the voyage by sea to Montreal can be made at as small expense as the journey by land to Manchester ! The passage money from Dublin to Montreal or Quebec (exclusive
            of food) has been as low as 30s ; and it would not be higher probably from Leith or Greenock, if the emigrants were in sufficient numbers, and so prompt in their arrangements, that the
            vessel lost no time beyond what was strictly necessary for taking her full compliment aboard. If the ship is detained a month before this is got, the owners must, of course, be indemnified
            for the detention by a higher fare. Four stone of oatmeal, with a little ham or salt fish for variety, will subsist a man or woman on the voyage ; and thus a human being can be conveyed
            over a distance equal to one-sixth part of the circumference of the globe, and six times longer, we dare say, than the wanderings of Ulysses, at the small coast of 45s !</p>
         <p>In an article in May 1832, we pointed out the rapid strides with which emigration was advancing ; and some Parliamentary papers we have received since, exhibit new proofs of its
            extraordinary progress. It has, in fact, outstripped the expectations of the most sanguine.</p>
         <p>The following table shows the number of person who have emigrated in the last eight years to North America, the Cape, and Australia :–</p>
         <p>British America. United States. Cape of G. Hope. Australia. Total. 1825 8,714 5,551 114 485 14,891 1826 12,818 7,063 116 903 20,900 1827 12, 14,526 114 715 28,003 1828 12,084 12,817 135
            1,056 26,092 1829 13,307 15,678 197 2,916 31,198 1830 30,574 24,887 204 1,242 56,907 1831 58,067 23,418 11 1,561 83,160 1832 66,339 32,872 196 3,733 103,140</p>
         <p>It will be seen from this table how steady the increase of emigration has been, especially to Canada. It must be observed, that a great proportion, probably more than a half of those who
            sailed for the United States, were destined for the British colonies, and only chose that route as the most eligible, on account of the facilities which the Hudson and its associated
            canals present for travelling to the upper province. Canada and Nova Scotia must have drawn at least 80,000 settlers from Britain last year ; and yet, such are the capacities of these
            colonies for absorbing population, that the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree ; and from the previous arrangements made, it is announced that a much larger number of
            persons could have been received without inconvenience ! Sanguine as we were upon the subject, we did not anticipate that emigration could be conducted on such a scale, with the
            extraordinary ease, certainty, and economy now exemplified. Those who reflect on the distress and perplexity which would be produced by landing the sixth-part of eighty thousand strangers
            on the shores of Britain in one summer, will appreciate the extremely dissimilar condition of a colony which, with less than a million inhabitants, can take in eighty-thousand new settlers
            in the same period without embarassment or confusion.</p>
         <p>The general result is, that Britain sent off 103,000 souls from her population last year, of whom a[?] number sailed 7000 miles, a number 14,000, and those who made the shortest voyage,
            4000 miles. The annals of emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any part of the world ; and yet we may reasonably expect to see still greater things atcheived.</p>
         <p>It appears from the various census since 1801, that the annual increase in Britain, if no persons left it, would be about 350,000; or we may place the fact in a more striking light by
            stating, that there are about a thousand persons more in the three kingdoms every day than there was on the day before. If by raising the habits and ideas of the labouring classes, we
            could get this daily increase reduced one half, and the other half could be carried off by emigration–if we could by this means keep the supply of labour stationary while capital was
            increasing, a great improvement would be effected in the state of the population. Now from what has been stated it appears that the emigrants who leave our shores annually amount to nearly
            onethird of the annual excess already ; and in a year or two there is every probability that it will amount to one-half.</p>
         <p>Of 51,200 emigrants who landed at Quebec and Montreal last year, 17,500 went from England, 28,200 from Ireland, and 5,500 from Scotland. In the year 1831, the numbers were, from England
            10,300, Ireland 34,100, Scotland 5,300.</p>
         <p>Of the emigrants from Scotland last year, 1716 sailed from Greenock, 1145 from Leith, 638 from Cromarty, 478 from Aberdeen, 439 from Dundee, 231 from Alloa, 181 from Islay, 175 from Anna,
            160 from Glasgow, 112 from Leven, 110 from Campbeltown, and numbers under 100 from Stanraer, Peterhead, and Irvine.</p>
         <p>Of the emigrants to the United States last year 15,754 sailed from Liverpool, 5,546 from London 2,742 from Bristol, 2,613 from Londonderry, and 1,711 from Greenock.</p>
         <p>Mr Buchanan, the Government agent at Quebec, states in his Report, that "the general description of emigrants who arrived last year ; many respectable and wealthy families came from all
            part of the united kingdom ; and the extent of property and specie brought into the country by them is exceedingly great, fully amounting to from t600,000 to t700,000 sterling." About 5000
            persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes or landlords ; and there were 1700 "commuted pensioners" (military, we believe), many of them men of irregular habits, and ill fitted
            for the situation of settlers. Of these, about 100 returned to Britain. The fear of cholera was a considerable check to emigration. It appeared in Quebec on the 8th of June, and the
            persons who arrived after that, suffered much from the difficulty of procuring lodgings even for a day ; but Mr Buchanan estimates the whole number of emigrants who fell victims to the
            disease, at no more than</p>
         <p>"The demand for all classes of working people (says the Report,) has never been exceeded in the Canadas, particularly since the abatement of the cholera, and I can assure your Lordship
            that, during my late tour through the districts and settlements of Upper Canada, I did not see an industrious emigrant who could not meet with emplyment. The number of that class arrived
            this year is not adequate to supply the demand created by the more wealthy emigrants. This was particularly felt in the Western and London districts of the upper province, where the want
            of labourers was so great that it was found necessary to encourage a number to come over from Ohio and Pennsylvania." This was written on the 12th Dec. 1832, and the arrival of emigrants
            closed in October.</p>

         <p>Emigration to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land</p>
         <p>The following document has just been issued from the Colonial Office:–</p>
         <p>Downing street, April 6, 1834. Numerous applicants have been received from persons desirous of emigrating to New South Wales or Van Dieman's Land, who, after stating their inability to
            defray the whole charge of their conveyance, solicit aid for that purpose, on condition of repaying the same out of their earnings in the colony where they propose to settle. His Majesty's
            government has sanctioned the appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial revenues of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, to assist the private funds of such emigrants as may
            appear likely to earn the means of repayig that aid, and to become useful settlers. The following are the regulations under which this induglence will be dispensed:–</p>
         <p>No advance will be made except to young and married agricultural labourers, who intend taking their wives and families with them : and a strict inquiry will be instituted into their
            character and habits of industry, before the assistance they solicit will be granted to them.</p>
         <p>No one family will be allowed an advance exceeding t20; and it will be useful therefore for parties, who may not possess the remainder of the sum requisite for defraying the expense of
            their passage, to apply for assistance.</p>
         <p>Every person desirous of receiving the proposed advance must fill up, and send back to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonial Department, the return hereto annexed. If the
            information contained in this return, and the answers to the inquiries which may be addressed to the parties who certify the correctness of the return, shall be considered satisfactory,
            the applicant will receive notice to that effect. He may then proceed to make his agreement with the owners or masters of ships proceeding to New South Wales or Van Diemen's land, and as
            soon as any ship-owner or master shall notify (in a form which will be provided for that purpose) that the emigrant has taken the other necessary steps for engaging his passage, and order
            will be granted for the payment in the colony, of t20 to the agent or master of the vessel in which this emigrant may arrive. The emigrant will of course be able to[?] ob-[?] tain a
            corresponding deduction from the amount[?] [?] paid by himself in this country.</p>
         <p>The order for payment will be entrusted [?] ter of the vessel in which the emigrants to pro[?] and will consist of a sealed dispatch to the governor, containing the name and description of
            the party on whose account the money is to be paid, and encolosing a promissory note, which he will be required to sign in acknowledgement of his debt ; which note must be witnessed by the
            captain and chief mate of the vessel. But arrangements will be made, by which the payment of this order will not take place in the colony until the captain shall have produced the parties,
            on whose account it is to be made, before the officer appointed for that purpose, and they shall have entered into a fresh obligation for the repayment of the advance made to them. For it
            is the intention of his Majesty's Government, and cannot be too clearly understoof by all persons who may accept this loan, that repayments of the debt (in such proportions and at such
            intervals as may not be unsuitable to the circumstances of each emigrant) shall be strictly enforced, by means of the ample powers which the laws of the colony render available for that
            purpose.</p>
         <p>Government agents for emigration have been appointed at Liverpool, Bristol, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Belfast, and Greenock, who have been instructed to afford gratuitous information to all
            persons applying to them as to the best means of carrying their schemes of emigration into effect. Parties, therefore, who may reside in the neighbourhood of these agents are requested to
            apply to them either personally (or if by letter post paid) for information on this subject.</p>
         <p>All application for the assistance of government must be made by letter only, addressed to R. W. Hay, Esq. Under Secretary of State, London ; and should the number of applications be
            greater than the funds at their disposal will enable them to comply with, priority of date will form the rule of selection among applications in which there shall appear no other groun of
            distinction. W. R. Hay.</p>

         <p>South Australian Emigration Association.</p>
         <p>A meeting of the members of the South Australian Association was held on Monday, at Exeter Hall, "for the purpose of explaining the principles, objects, plan, and prospects of a new
            colony," proposed to be founded in South Australia. Mr W. Whitmore in the chair.</p>
         <p>Upon taking the chair, Mr Whitmore stated, that the first question which the meeting would have to consider would be this–whether there existed or not at present any necessity for a more
            extended system of colonization. It appeared to him that there was a great defect in our present system of colonication, and that it would be greatly to our advantage if we established it
            upon a new principle, well and seriously considered. That which struck him as the greatest defect was, that we did not provided that colonization which included within it members of all
            classes of society. Large numbers of emigrants went out with capital, but not carrying with them that number of the lower class which was necessary to employ their capital to advantage. In
            other cases, perhaps almost as numerous, the labourer went out without capital which was necessry to enable him to employ his labour to advantage. This was a striking defect. Now the
            question which they were then called upon to consider, regarded the best means of remedying that defect. Those means, it appeared to him, were quite practicable, and might be accomplished
            in this manner, vz. by establishing as a system that all the waste lands which they were about to colonize should be sold at a given price, such as the market would command, and that the
            proceeds of such sales should be employed in sending out to the colonies a sufficient number of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold. If this system could be carried into effect, he
            apprehended that all the evils of our present system of colonization would be removed, and that we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the community of the mother country with all
            its various grades into the new country which they now proposed to coloniz. He believed that if we proceeded upon this principle, we should lay the foundation of the greatest colony which
            England had ever settled.</p>
         <p>Mr Grote, M.P., moved the first resolution,–"That the wealth and prosperity of this country have been greatly promoted by the establishment of British colonies in various parts of the
            world, and that colonization, when conducted systematically and upon sound principles, offers the means of extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the united kingdom, and the field
            of employment for British capital and labour." He would not enter into the recommendations which this undertaking offered to all classes of the community ; but he would venture to state,
            that to any gentleman who considered the prospectus which had been put out by the association, and who recollected that it was a matter of certainty that the land in the colony was to be
            used as the means of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour, which was superabundant here, it must be evident that from this important innovation on our colonial system great
            benefit must be derived[?] both to the new colony and to the mother country.</p>
         <p>Mr Clay, M.P., in seocnding the resolution, entered at great length into the difficulty of finding employment, which now prevails in all parts of the community, and then, after condemning
            the corn laws, continued thus–Colonization, if carried on to a considerable extent, would as effectually add millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the Irish sea were filled up with
            fertile land. If that miracle took place is it not clear that all distress would immediately cease, and that the emplyment which the addition of so many fertile acres would afford must
            give a new stimulus to the prosperity of the country ? Is it not clear that the miserable compotation[?] for potato-gardens in Ireland would cease, and that the difficulties flowing from
            an unemployed population would cease ? Does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of our capitalists to take such land at from 10s to 20s an acre. (Hear.) Yet this plan is in
            effect the same as if the land were added to our own island, because, if this plan of colonization be adopted, a transplantation of a sufficiency of labourers, now wanting employment, from
            this country, for its culture, will take place, which is equivalent to the transportation of the land to the labourer. In point of fact, the ocean joins these distant lands, instead of
            separating them. (Hear.)– There can be no doubt but that a wider comercial code, and the removal of restrictions on labour, would greatly facilitate, extend, and increase the commercial
            intercourse between the old nation of the world ; but in no case would the increase be in proportion to that which might be calculated on, as the consequence of a connection with
            newly-formed countries in other climates. As regards the establishment of colonies, it is virtually an extension of the mother country.</p>
         <p>Colonel Torrens, M.P., proposed the second resolution– "That in establishing colonies, great care ought to be taken to combine labour and capital with land, in such proportions as are best
            calculated to insure the prosperity of all classes of society, and that, in establishing modern colonies, this important consideration has been so generally overlooked." It was, he said,
            almost unnecessary for him to state that in all systems of colonization, land, labour, and capital, ought to be combinedin just proportions ; and yet this simple principle had been
            hitherto greatly neglected by those who had led new colonies from the mother country. In the first place, the whole of the land of this colony was to be public land. No individual was to
            obtain a single acre by gift. There was to be no patronage, no job–all were to be on a footing of equality, and nobody was to have a single inch of land for nothing. There would also be
            another advantage in this system, which would arise in the following :–In other colonies, the labourer who had gone out and found that he could get land for nothing, had often fallen into
            the mistake that land was wealth, instead of it being merely the means of producing wealth. That fatal mistake had often led him to refuse the work of the master with whom he had gone out,
            and set up for himself as an independent landowner. He had in consequence set up, where he was far away from the market of the colony, where he had no roads over which to convey his
            produce, and where he had perished miserably. But in this colony the labourers would be compelled for some time to work for hire.</p>
         <p>Mr Guest, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
         <p>Mr Hutt, M.P. moved the third resolution to the following effect:–"That in order to promote the greatest prosperity of a new colony, it is expedient that all waste land, without any
            exception, shall be declared public land, and be disposed of to individuals by sale only, and according to an uniform, impartial, and permanent system."</p>
         <p>Captain Gowan seconded the resolution, and spoke in the highest terms of the salubrity of the climate of Australia. Many of his fellow soldiers in India had gone there for the recovery of
            their health, and had found something so temperate and soothing in the country, that they had retired there altogeher, preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the chills of their native
            country, England.</p>
         <p>Mr P. Scrope, M.P. moved "That it is also desirable that the whole of the purchase money of public land, without any deduction, should be employed in providing a free passage from the
            mother country to the colony, of young adult persons of the labouring class, who may be willing to emigrate, and in equal proportion of both sexes." As the want of labour was the great
            difficulty in all infant colonies, the more labour they imported, the greater labour did they give their land ; the more they got for the sale of it, the greater was their power of
            importing fresh labour. This resolution, therefore, acted in a reciprocal manner upon itself, and when it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed onwards on the road to
            prosperity with accelerated velocity, meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of England to part with her inhabitants.</p>
         <p>Mr Wilks, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
         <p>Mr Handson moved –"That amongst the unoccupied portions of the earth which form part of the British dominions, the south coast of Australia appears to be a sport peculiarly suitable for
            founding a colony upon the principles embodied in the preceding resolutions." The place where this colony was to be founded was one distinguished from every other part of Australia, from
            its possessing a facility of internal communications prior even to the formation of roads, and the soil would amply repay the labour expended on its cultivation.</p>
         <p>Mr Robert Owen (not of Lanark) said that the coasts of this colony abounded with whales, and that its whale fisheries might become valuable.</p>
         <p>Mr M. D. Hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the mode of carrying the principles of this association into effect. No colony could go on without some law. He did not care how
            little they had of it, provided they made up in quality what was deficient in quantity. The hon. member entered into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enacted for the
            colony, and concluded by moving–"That the provisions for the peace, order, and good government of the British Province of South Australia, as contained in the bill now before Parliament,
            are highly satisfactory."</p>
         <p>Mr D. Wakefield seconded the resolution.</p>
         <p>Sir W. Molesworth, M.P. proposed, and Mr Childers, M.P., seconded the following resolution :–"That it is the opinion of this meeting that the thanks of the country are due to Mr Spring
            Rice for his prompt and enlightened conduct in promoting the beneficial public object of the South Australian Association."</p>
         <p>The resolutions were carried unanimously. Thanks were given to the Chairman, and the meeting, at which many ladies were present, broke up. The proceedings lasted from twelve o'clock to a
            quarter before five.</p>

         <p>House of Commons.–July 28 (Continued from our last.)</p>
         <p>A message from the Lords announced that their Lordships had agreed to the Amendments to the Ministers Appointment (Scotland) bill ; to the Newspaper Postage bill ; and to the Orkney
            Statute Labour bill.</p>
         <p>Affairs of Oude</p>
         <p>On the order of the day for the third reading of the Universities' Admission bill being moved–</p>
         <p>Mr Herriks[?] took the occasion of calling on Government to explain the circumstances which had occurred in certain transactions between the Board of Controul and the East India directors.
            These transactions, the hon. gentleman stated, to be the repeated peremptory commands of the Board of Controul to the Directors of the East India Company to prepare a despatch for the
            purpose of directing the Indian Government to compel the King of Oude, to pay certain claims made on him on behalf of Calcutta bankers, which commands the Court of Directors refused to
            obey, on the ground that the interference which the Board of Controul required them to exercise with the King of Oude, was inconsistent with the relations subsisting between the British
            Government and the King of Oude, and would be most mischievous in effect. On the 31st of January the right jon. gentleman had appliedfor, and obtained a rule to show cause why, under the
            act of Parliament, a mandamus should not issue to compel the Court of Directors to comply with the desire ofthe Board of Controul. On the 31st of January, 1834, the Court of King's bench
            was prepared to give its decision upon the application for the mandamus, when, without any reason being assigned, the right hon. President of the Board of Controul withdrew his
            application.</p>
         <p>Mr C. Grant said that in the regret which had been expressed respecting the possible collision between the two authorities, he fully concurred; bu, entertaining such a sentiment, he
            confessed it surprised him not a little to find his Right Hon. Friend endeavouring to open a dispute already composed. The right honourable gentleman then proceeded to give a brief outline
            of the case, and referred to the various high authorities connected with India, who had declared in favour of the demand. With regard to his having withdrawn the application for the
            mandamus without explanation, he had to say that he fully explain his opinions to the Directors, he had re-stated them verbally to the chairman, and he did not think himself required,
            under the circumstances, to reenter into a long discussion upon the point. The effect of the recommendation to the King of Oude was merely to urge the claim upon his attention.</p>
         <p>Sir R. Peel said it was a perfectly novel doctrine, and in the present state of the world most inconvenient, that the nonpayment of debts due to his subjects should give the King of
            England a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states, except where sanctioned by positive treaty.</p>
         <p>Mr Hume contended, that on the whole, the debt was a just one, and ought to be paid.</p>
         <p>The subject here dropped.</p>
         <p>Admission of Dissenters to the Universities.</p>
         <p>On the question that this bill be read a third time,</p>
         <p>Mr T. Gladstone rose to oppose it. It would, he said, be useless to pass the bill, for it would of necessity be inoperative. If he were asked why he opposed a bill which, if passed, would
            be inoperative, his answer was that he objected to its principle, the admission of which was equally destructive, whether it effected the object of its promoters or not. Further, they were
            bound to respect corporate rights as long as the intentions of their founders were fulfilled ; and no one could deny that the Universities did fulfilthe intentions of their founders."
            (Hear, hear.)</p>
         <p>Mr V. Smith supported the bill, as one calculated to take away a reproach from the Establishment, and be felt as a compliment by the Dissenters, whose only desire was to exercise their
            vigorous intellects in the promotion of science and literature.</p>
         <p>Mr Baines said, that the original statutes showed that there were then no tests, nor did any exist at Oxford, in either the time of the Lollards or of Wickliff. The term University had in
            it an argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learning, which were meant to be universal, both as to the subjects taught, and the persons to whom they were communicated. In this
            sense, the term was understood and applied in other countries, and it was an extraordinary fact, deserving of attention, that the Universities of Oxford and of Cambridge were the only
            universities that were closed to a large proportion of the upper classes of the people in any country in Europe. This the Dissenters of England felt as a grievous indignity, and they
            thought it unjust that Englishmen should attempt to degrade Englishmen by excluding them from the best seats of literature and science.</p>
         <p>Mr H. Hughes could not accede to the measure, and therefore moved that it be read that day six months.</p>
         <p>Mr Goulburn contended that the introduction of the Dissenters, as proposed under the present bill, would be nothing short of the destruction of the present system of education at the
            Universities. It was indisputable that at a University, religion could only be taught according to some set form : abandon that mode of tuition, and you abandon the religion itself. (Cries
            of "No, no.") If they let in Dissenters, it was perfectly obvious the intentions of the founders of those establishments would be completely defeated : he therefore deprecated the measures
            as injurious to religon and opposed to the best interest of the country.</p>
         <p>Lord Palmerstone, Sir R. Inglis, and Mr G. Wood then addressed the house, but amidst such discordant noises as prevented what they said being heard. The laughing, jeering, shouting, were
            such as has seldom been heard. In particular two hon. members who entered from the smoking room into the opposite gallery during the address of Mr Wood, and who stretched themselves at
            full length on the seats secure from the observation of the Speaker, kept up a row of the most discreditable character. The Speaker, with much indignation in his tone and manner, called
            the parties to order.</p>
         <p>The motion for the third reading was carried, on a division, by 164 to 25. The Trading Companies Bill, the Arms Importation (Ireland) Bill, and the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill, went
            through committees.</p>
         <p>The Four Courts (Dublin) Bill, the Weights and Measures Bill, and the Turnpike Acts Amendment Bill, were read a third time and passed.</p>
         <p>The Almanack Stamps Repeal Bill, the Assessed Taxes Repeal Bill, and the Militia Ballot Suspension Bill, were brought in, and read a first time.</p>
         <p>The house was counted out at three o'clock in the morning.</p>
         <p>Tuesday, July 29.</p>
         <p>Sir John Cam Hobhouse and General Sir Edward Barnes, took the oaths and their seats ; the former for Nottingham, in the room of Lord Duncannon, raised to the Peerage ; the latter for
            Sudbury, in the room of M. A. Taylor, Esq. deceased.</p>
         <p>On the motion of Mr Alderman Thompson the Durham and Sunderland Railway bill was read a third time and passed.</p>
         <p>Southern Australia</p>
         <p>Mr S. Rice moved the order of the day for the house to resolve into Committee upon the Bill for the Colonization of Southern Australia,</p>
         <p>Mr A. Baring rose and stated various objections to the project. The hon. member contended that at this period of the year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important subject,
            and, independent of this preliminary objection, he said he did not conceive that government ought to sanction any such experiment without a full conviction that there was a reasonable
            probability of its success. In his opinion the experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken than any similar one which had ever been tried. In fact, according to the plan which had been
            laid down, the colony would be tied up by mortgages in such a way, that it would not again revert to the Crown, so that the territory would be lost. The result would be, that if the
            gentlemen who set the project on foot were mistaken–as he was sure they had been–we would be prevented from touching this large portion of Australia, unless we could pay off the debt which
            had been contracted. While he stated these objections to the plan, he was anxious not to be understood to be inimical to colonization, for he was very favourable to it. Every new opening
            to colonization he was convinced was a substantial benefit to the poorer classes, (Hear, hear, hear.) It was not, therefore, to the principle of colonization that he was opposed, but he
            objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most mistaken one, and would eventually shut up this large portion of the world. One of his main objections was to the extent to which it was
            proposed to carry the experiment. Let the gentlemen take, if they like, 100 square miles, but let them not risk the whole of a great continent. People, like fuel, he said, could not well
            be carried too far ; they might get a few thousands to go out, but they would never get the tens of thousands to go which were required for the success of the project. The hon. member then
            objected to two of the principles which were laid down by the projectors, that land should not be sold lower than 12s. per acre, and that no credit should be given. He was convinced that
            any man acquainted with the practical workings of the system in other colonies, would blow up the whole plan in a moment. No man who went out to Australia would think of taking less than
            two hundred acres. Now that would cost him t120; it would cost him t120 more to get himself and his family over; which, with stock and other expenses, would amount to t500 or t600. He
            would, therefore, ask any gentlemen in that house, whether they thought any man who had t500 or t600 in this country, would go out and set himself down on two hundred acres in Australia.
            (Hear, hear.) He therefore suggested to his right hon. friend to consent that the committee be postponed until another session, and then have it referred to a select committee. He
            concluded by moving, as an amendment, that the bill be committed on that day six months.</p>
         <p>Mr W. Whitmore was thakful for the very candid manner in which the hon. member had stated his objections to the bill. With respect to the large extent of territory, he (Mr W.) thought that
            was necessary, as it was intended to introduce a completely new system of colonization–one very different from any thing ever before attempted. The extent of land it was intended to take
            under this act was from 500,000 to 600,000 square miles, and it was the leading principle of the bill that all the money arising from the sale of lands should be applied to the purpose of
            sending out labourers free of expense.– (Hear, hear, hear.) If this plan succeeded, there would be a constant stream of emigrants going out. The land sold by the Canada Company had been at
            a higher price. He had sanguine hopes that all the money it would be necessary to borrow would be easily repaid. He most conscientously considered that this bill would prove a very great
            benefit to the country. It would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and amending the conditions of the people of England and Ireland, and therefore he hoped it would pass.</p>
         <p>Mr O'Dwyer contended that, before the house thought of agreeing to such a bill as this, they ought to do something towards the ameloriation of the condition of the people of Ireland. The
            various reports which committees of that house had made, showed that one-fourth of the land of that country was untilled, but was at the same time what was called reclaimable land, and
            well calculated for the cultivation and produce of grain. Let this country advance some of the surplus capital talked of by the hon. member towards the cultivation of this bog land, and
            discontent would flee[?] from Ireland entirely. The Irish people wanted employment, give them that and the house would hear no more about murders, fires, and other outrages.</p>
         <p>Mr S. Rice in reference to the allusion made by the hon. and learned member, begged to say that, although much of the bog land in question belonged to private individuals, yet a portion of
            it was the property of the Government, who had been, and still were, making experiments, with a view to ascertain if the views of the Commissioners could be carried into effect. With
            respect to the manner in which the hon. member for Essex had opened this question, he must confess that he had brought with him much of usefulness and of experience, and of such a
            character, too, as could not fail to carry weight. The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to speak in favour of the proposed colonization of South Australia</p>
         <p>After some farther discussion, strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the house divided, when there appeared–For going into committee, 72; against it 7–Majority, 65.</p>
         <p>The bill went through the committee. The report was received, and ordered to be taken into further consideration on Thursday next.</p>
         <p>Several petitions were presented, and, at three o'clock, the Speaker left the chair.</p>

         <p>Colonel C. J. Napier has been appointed Governor of the embryo colony in South Australia, and we believe that a fitter appointment could not have been made. We only regret that Colonel
            Napier has not been sent to superintend a colony founded on something like sane principles. But if this Australian project end, as we have little doubt it will do, in the ruin of those who
            are weak and silly enough to embark in it, no one will ascribe any part of the failure to the incapacity or unfitness of the Governor. The whole blame will fall on the contrivers of the
            scheme.</p>

         <p>Emigration. –According to a general return of emigrants who have left Liverpool for the British colonies and the United States of America, it appears that from the 7th of May 1833, to the
            30th September 1834, 3,121 persons left there for the colonies, and 27,486 for the United States, making a grand total of 30,607 persons. The ships employed were 455 ; the tonnage 196,058,
            and the crews, 8,9956. The chief of the emigrants to the United States, disembarked at New York, 24,311 having landed there. Of the emigrants to the colonies, 1,289 went to Australia, and
            1,227 to Quebec. The emigration to the West Indies during the above period, only amounted to 12 to the smaller islands, 3 to Antigua, 32 to Jamaica, and 26 to Demerara. The emigrants to
            Van Diemen's Land were 135.</p>

         <p>Emigration –We observe from an advertisement in our paper of to-day, that another ship is fitting out by Government, for the free conveyance of females to Van Dieman's Land ; and as we
            understand that many applications were made too late for the last ship, we would recommend those anxious to take advantage of this opportunity, to lose no time in making the neccessary
            application at Leith,–the number being strictly limited, and being the last ship to sail this year. We consider it of great advantage to females of respectability, that none are admitted
            without a strict investigation into their moral character by the Emigration Committee ; and that those of a superior class, as governesses, &amp;c. are provided a small sum, to defray the
            expense of the extra outfit.</p>

         <p>South Australia. –The act of Parliament for founding this colony will now come into full operation ; the Commissioners having complied with the conditions precedent, by the sale of t35,000
            worth of land, and by raisingthe required loan for the government of the colony. We may therefore expect shortly to see the names of the various officers gazetted (some of them have been
            long ago nominated) ; and we understand that active preparations are making with a view to the immediate departure of the officers and a small body of emigrants. This first expedition will
            be placed under the command of Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., the Governor ; who, with the assistance of the Surveyors and other qualified persons, will carefully examine the various harbours in
            the colony, the quality of the neighbouring soil, the supply of water, &amp;c. ; and will select that site which, all things considered, is most desirable for the first town. We believe it
            is the intention of the Commissions not to send out the main body of emigrants until the next spring, so as to allow ample time for the necessary preparations for their reception.–
            Spectator.</p>
         <p>There have been 300 convents suppressed within the last three years. The example was set by the Emperor of Russia, who, was by an ukase, dated 31st July 1832, abolished 187 convents of
            monks. This was followed by the King of Prussia, who, by a royal order, secularised all the convents in the Duchy of Posen. In 1834, Don Pedro put down 300 convents, and Spain has lately
            abolished 1800.</p>

         <p>Emigration. –It will be observed, from an advertisement in to-day's paper, that Government are fitting another ship for the free conveyance of single females from London to Van Dieman's
            Land ; and from the great demand for agricultural labourers, and mechanics of every description, in that colony, it has been resolved to grant a passage to that class, at a cost not above
            what is paid to America–Government paying the remainder of the sum as a bounty, amounting to t30, which may certainly be looked upon as a great boon, both by individuals and the colony at
            large. In all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of working people, as from an official document in our possession, it is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada agricultural
            labourers, domestic servants, and tradesmen of every description, will be for some years in great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from t25 to t30 per annum, with board, lodging, and
            washing, and day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day, with provisions. The government agent for emigration for the Canadas asserts he could find immediate employment for 20,000 working
            people, as public improvements are much retarded for want of hands. As this is the best season, we would advise all those intending to emigrate to apply to the government agent for
            emigration at the Custom House, Leith, who will give gratuitous information regarding the colonies, and advise as to the best method of putting their plans into execution. The rate of
            wages for every description of mechanics may be likewise seen there.</p>

         <p>Australian Colonies.–We have seen a printed circular containing extracts of a letter from Mr John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emigrant ship Canton, dated Sydney, 6th October
            1835, addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the Emigration Committee, London. In this letter Mr Sullivan mentions that the female emigrants, on landing, were placed in spacious and
            commodious buildings, adjoining the Government House, at Sydney, where every attention was paid to their comfort and security from improper intrusion. The writer further states :–" We
            landed in Sydney a greater proportion of well conducted, industrious, and virtuous young women, than were ever before landed from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee that came to
            these Colonies. Three-fourths of the young women were engaged, and went into comfortable situations, on the first and second days after landing ; and before a week all the useful and good
            servants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work, dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many of them in Syndey and the surroundings districts ; several were taken up the
            country to Maitland and Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses, dairymaids, or farm servants as we had, could obtain places in that time, for these are the descriptions of female
            servants in demand throughout the colony. The wages varied from t8 to t20. Some, who were not very good servants of all work and housemaids, got t8 to t10 ; cooks and laundresses, t12 to
            t16 (the latter are much wanted) ; housemaids and needlewomen, t10 to t12 ; housekeepers, t16 to t20. Governesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had twenty qualified they could
            have got situations in respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to this class are small, say t25 to t40. Nursery governesses got t20. All the male emigrants who understood
            agriculture, or the management of stock in general, but particularly sheep, were engaged immediately, at salaries varying from t40 to t50, with a house and rations for family use." We
            understand that the Canton had a number of females from Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, and the above information must be highly satisafactory to their relatives.</p>

         <p>Sir George Clerk. –As the cawing of the rooks portends a storm, it is worth while to mention that the cunning baronet has come down from London, and commenced a canvass in this county
            within these few days. It is stated, we believe upon good authority, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the
            Irish Municipal Bill.</p>
         <p>Burn's Monument. –We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument, which has too long remained in an unfinished state, to the surprise of strangers,
            and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, which he has generously
            devoted to that purpose, is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect, therefore,
            that the work will forthwith be commenced, and if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any
            loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking.</p>
         <p>Annuity Tax. –We understand that deputations from several places in the country, are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of
            petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax, in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its
            support. We observe that Mr Gillon, of Wallhouse, M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not, will be most numerously attended.</p>
         <p>Law of Scotland. –The prizes given by Professor Bell, for the greatest proficiency in the examinations, were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish, 25, India Street, in the senior, and to
            William Spence, 31, Broughton Place, in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser, James Gilchrist, James Mason, James
            Scott, in the senior class; James Oliver, David Gale, John R. Banks, James Charles Murray, Wm. M'Naughton, in the junior.</p>
         <p>Kilwinning, March 30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday, the 22d March, and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in
            that place. The Rev. D. Henderson, of Dalry, preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns, of Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D. Ronald, of Saltcoats, gave the charge to the minister and
            congregation. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait, of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed
            congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister.</p>
         <p>Presentation of Plate. –Mr A. S. Walker, late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was
            lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment, bearing the following inscription :– "Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the Uttoxeter
            Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March, 1836." This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the
            young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return, just published, we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year.
            The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597
            adult males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England, 3067 Ireland,
            7,108 Scotland, 2,127 From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &amp;c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 Upper Canada, 9,800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 Returned to the United Kingdom, 117
            Removed to the United States, 300 –12,527</p>
         <p>But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 landed at New York, raising the whole number of emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to
            Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork, with 48 persons on board,
            passengers and crew, of whom 41 were lost.</p>
         <p>From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free
            passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small, and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character, and due care was taken on their
            arrival to get them disposed of as servants, in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk.</p>
         <p>Ulster Railway. –Length 36 miles, from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600,000, in 12,000 shares, of which t393,000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450,000; the expected
            income is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539,000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310, 320, and 570 yards in
            length.</p>
         <p>East Lothian Railway. –We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh, by Haddington and Tranent, which appears in our first page. No one can
            have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication, by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such
            a work would pay, had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland, from the German ocean to the Atlantic,
            its chances of success are vastly increased.</p>
         <p>Dundee and Arbroath Railway. –The Committee's report on this railway has reached us, but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the
            capital t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all subscribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally
            interested t88,900, by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16,912, goods t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no
            tunnels, no inclined planes, and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated
            expenses is t99,844.</p>
         <p>Statute Labour Acts. –It appears from the votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts, and to consider what
            amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated, that by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any
            burden, on account of the coaches, chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep, though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land, upon
            whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds, were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in
            heritors, rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards, though it is stated with confidence, that were the occupiers of land included, beneficial consequences would follow.– East- Lothian
            Correspondent.</p>
         <p>Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society. – The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton, Esq., one of the Honorary Members, President of the
            Society, in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read, and thanks were voted to the different Officebearers. It appears that this society was established under the
            countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers, and various influential individuals in Leith, and is well deserving of encouragement, as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the
            working classes, the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds, we understand, are in a prosperous state.</p>
         <p>Hay and Straw. –In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted, we have made due inquiry, and find there are no grounds
            for such an allegation. We have been further assured, that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to
            favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers, or to favour either party at the expense of the public.</p>
         <p>The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant, dated the 6th of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to
            the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field.</p>
         <p>Heriot's Hospital. –At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday the 7th instant, the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel,
            amounting to t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago.
            Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel, which was described by
            Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for
            admission of boys, preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus classed :–</p>
         <p>Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital, or any other institution, 12 Those who have received benefit for one child, 13 Do. for two children, 6 Do. for three
            children, 5 Do. for five children, 1 37</p>
         <p>In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference, first to children of widows (being poor), then to those who have never received benefit, afterwards those
            who have had only one child in, and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children, and one for an orphan, out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, considering
            the large population of Edinburgh, that it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in his will, expressly points out the fatherless and poor, being children of burgesses and
            freemen, as the objects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not
            appear to have strong claims, simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy. –On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political
            Economy, delivered by Dr Thomas Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the members of
            committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, was called to the Chair, and some
            conversation having taken place, the committee of management, who had necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the meeting in their office, and empowered to take such steps as they
            might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper, some evening next week, on the occasion of
            being presented with a piece of silver plate.</p>
         <p>It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, Esq. of Newington Cottage, died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his
            acquaintance, and his death will be long and deeply regretted.</p>
         <p>Rare Sights in London. –A young Scottish Miss, who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt, returned the other day by one of the steamers, and was met on landing by various
            members of her family, who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. " Seen !" exclaimed the fair tourist "I have seen such sights ! I saw the Theological Garden, and all the wild
            beasts in't!"</p>
         <p>The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been
            with us for a whole month, and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number
            beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello,
            Shylock, and King John, investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest, and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius, which
            could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard, which character he
            has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of
            the audience were loud and long, and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and
            delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:–" Ladies and Gentlemen, –I now stand before you for the last time this season, but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may
            bend, my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till
            that period permit me with a heavy, but a grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell." (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of
            the house.) –Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there, we are told, are already taken for several
            successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey, from the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, makes her appearance here on Monday first.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, baker, Castle Street, was entertained at supper, in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a party of friends, of about fifty in number,
            previous to his leaving this country for America, to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious, and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey.</p>
         <p>Qualifications of General Assembly Elders. –The Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to
            represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an elder there. Against
            his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, as we understand, that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating
            elder; the protesters allowing that his election, though consistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained, it is
            evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that when the commissions came to be attested, he
            would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of
            domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say, he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect.</p>
         <p>The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one, who, during a long and
            useful life, has done so much for the cause of literature and religion, the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which will entitle
            them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton, and even the general church-going
            community, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even
            beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the
            General Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an unwearied research into
            the Natural History, and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– The Illustrations of Scripture –will long bear testimony to the
            extent of his learning, and of his Oriental investigations, and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's
            merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study, reflects high honour on the discrimination and the
            heart of Mr Tennant.</p>
         <p>Public Dinner to Professor Dick. –On Tuesday last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from
            various parts of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were
            Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Samuel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present
            we observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary to the Highland
            Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &amp;c. The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate
            speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as
            a man of talent, which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Patrons
            of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a
            late hour.</p>
         <p>Royal Infirmary –We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball, been
            enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s. 8d. The managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at large, are
            certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in support of this great and useful
            institution, for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.</p>

         <p>Papers from Madras to the 17th of January have been received. Accounts had arrived through Singapore, from the ship Mangles, stating that when passing through Torres Straits she touched at
            Murray's Island, where they discovered eight Europeans, part of the crew of the long-missing bark, Charles Eaton, in a state of slavery, but the natives would not deliver up the men. The
            Charles Eaton was supposed to have been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits, in 1833, in prosecution of her voyage from New South Wales to Madras, but no precise intelligence of
            her fate was previously known. The ironworks which had been erected at Porto Novo were proceeding with activity, and some railing had been made there, quite equal, it is stated to anything
            og the kind manufactured in England.</p>

         <p>Every thing is jobbed Female Emigration to Australia, &amp;c. (From a Correspondent.)</p>
         <p>Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferently managed; and we are glad to find that such a man as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Diemen's Land; and the sooner an
            improved system is adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human nature, a knowledge of which is essential to the management of the
            heterogenous materials of our penal colonies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our rulers have the sense to see the
            importance of sending our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust an Emigration Committee, and this committee trusts individuals who desire to make the most of the concern ;
            and we are glad to have an opportunity of making the public acquainted with the mode in which the business is conducted, in the hope that some humane Member of Parliament will take the
            subject up. The mode of managing female emigration is this :–</p>
         <p>A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a free passage to Australia. A ship is hired, and this ship must ave a full cargo, to satisfy the owners. Advertisements are issued, and
            instead of hard working females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dressmakers, &amp;c. &amp;c., with a small mixture of better articles, is made up. But if, as almost always happens, a
            sufficient number of these to fill the ship does not come forward, a supply of sweepings is taken from a workhouse! Here, then, is such a mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to the
            amount of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the poor creatures they are crammed four into one bed !</p>
         <p>Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to know the fact, that some young women of respectability who wished to go to New South Wales with their friends, were refused a free passage,
            unless they went to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we see that the interests of agents and shipowners overcomes the interests of the colonies, and actually obstructs the
            attainment of the object in view. We find blindness a very common ailment in every department of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may be to reform every abuse, and to adopt
            useful measures, they are often thwarted by the necessity (which ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches, which devour the public substance, and suck the public blood.
            Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the inside in our day. It is the duty, however, of all patriots, to sharpen the knife that is to
            cut out corruption from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of exposure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to support those who are willing to apply it.</p>
         <p>As in a matter of so much importance nothing should be concealed, there is no hesitation in stating that it consists with our knowledge that, after the Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's
            Land, detailing the deplorable consequences of sending out young women from workhouses, a ship has actually sailed, nearly filled up as we have described. When any representation is made
            to a public office, the matter is said to belong to another department ; and that other department says it is not its province to interfere ; and thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to
            the battledore of jobbing and the blindness of office.</p>
         <p>If our brethren of the press will take up this, the inhuman job will be put an end to.</p>

         <p>Emigration Mr Walter moved, pursuant to notice, that "an humble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he will be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard
            entitled "Emigration to Van Diemen's Land," which the several postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed to put in a conspicuous place in their several post-offices, and to
            circulate among the clergy and the parochial authorities be withdrawn." He had been assured y several gentlemen who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the young females sent
            out by the Emigration committee had been irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as obtained services found themselves placed among a very different calss of persons to that
            which they had been accustomed to mix with in this country. The hon. member read an extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the 19th of February last, in which it was stated that some of the
            females "thus launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thirteen years old.</p>
         <p>Mr Wakley seconded the motion. Sir G. Grey adverted to the extraordinary object of the address, when the information desired had in fact already been given on a former day. He hoped,
            whatever information, correct or erroneous, might be circulated on the subject of emigration, that the people of England would not adopt their notions from anonymous paragraphs in Hobart
            Town newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a system in operation by which people were driven out of the country–actually turned out of it, as if they were so many slaves. Now
            he could declare that there could be no more unfounded statement than this. Though much good had arisen to the colonies and individuals, yet it could not be denied that, in some instances,
            youn women had turned out badly They had these facts upon authority–that many of those females obtained respectable places. The names of the individuals who obtained them, the dates of
            their arrival, the mode of their meployment, were all to be found int he papers on the table of the house. In conclusion, he begged of the hon. member and others, when statements relative
            to emigration were made, to receive them with caution and reserve.</p>
         <p>Mr C. Lushington defended the proceedigs of the Emigration Committee. he mainted that by their labours the greatest posible good had been accomplished, hear, hear.) He would then ask of
            any one to look at the names of the gentlemen who were on that committee–to look at their characters; and could any one who did so believe that the members of that committee would be
            guilty of the sin of sendng out, day after day, young females to the colonies–of thus duping those unprotected creatures to their destruction? (hear, hear.)</p>
         <p>Mr Walter replied. He had not relied for his statements upon newspapers, but upon official documents.</p>
         <p>The motion was negatived without a division.</p>

         <p>State of Trade.</p>
         <p>The Wool Trade, London, Thursday Evening. –The following are more accurate averages of the sales of Colonial Wools which have recently taken place than we were enabled to obtain during
            their progress.</p>
         <p>The Colonial Wools offered consisted of 2041 bays. The Wools have become much improved in growth, in length of staple, in management, and in washing. The market being very bare in
            combining wool, this description realized a proportionate advance. Several flocks attracted great attention, particularly those market T A in a square, I X and Y, which show that great
            pains have been paid by the growers upon them. The correct averages obtained are as follows :–</p>
         <p>Van Diemen's Land.</p>
         <p>s. d. s. d. Choice flocks T A in a square 2 9 to 3 1 per lb. Do. I X 2 0 1/2 2 9 Do. Y 1 8 2 9 Good flocks 2 2 3/4 2 9 1/2 Ordinary and fair quality 1 4 1/2 2 2 1/2 Inferior and in the
            great 1 2 1 4</p>
         <p>Australian</p>
         <p>Good flocks 2 6 2 9 Fair 2 3 1/2 2 5 Inferior 1 11 2 2 and in the grease 1 3</p>
         <p>The frist class of Van Diemen's Land Wool realised a considerable rise upon last year's sales, the produce of the same flocks then selling only at 2s 2d to 2s 5d per lb.</p>
         <p>The Wool Trade is very brisk. The arrivals this week have been 2300 bales, of which about 340 are German, 1000 Spanish, 300 New South Wales, 20 Cape of Good Hope, 50 Turkey, and 500 bales
            of South American Woo's.</p>
         <p>Huddersfield, Tuesday.–There has been no visible change in the state of this market for the last three or four weeks. Business in general is pretty good.</p>
         <p>Bradford, June 30.–The activity we have so often had to report in the piece market continues unabated, and in six quarters, especially low and middle sorts, trade to-day is particularly
            brisk. Whatever alteration there may be in the yarn market, as compared with recent reports, is for the better. Stocks continue low in the staplers' hands, with very little disposition to
            increase them. Prices remain very steady, although the demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers are rather firmer. The Liverpool sales of New South Wales Wool went off 1d to 2d per
            lb. above the recent London sales.</p>
         <p>Rochdale, June 27.–The market this week was very well attended, but not so brisk as the last.–Low goods were much in demand, and sold well. The trade in Rochdale is generally good at
            present, and building is going on to a very considerale extent.</p>
         <p>York Wool Market, June 30.–The quantity of wool brought to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a considerable
            portion of business was done, and last week's quotations were fully supported :–good, bred hog 18 1/2d ; half hog and ewe, 16 1/2d to 17d ; all ewe, 15d to 15 1/2d ; locks without cots 10
            1/2 to 11 1/2d ; ditto with cots 11d to 12 1/2d per lb.</p>

         <p>Emigration. –The Emigration committee recently came to a resolution, "that adverting to the information imparted to the committee, both collectively and individually, of the excessive

         <p>South Australia</p>
         <p>We have received the first annual Report of new colony of South Australia, a Parliamentary paper presented in June last. The site selected for the colony is a part of the south coast of
            New Holland, extending two or three hundred miles on each side of Spencer's Gulf, and about 600 miles into the interior. It was anticipated that the best central station would be Port
            Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north coast of Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and east longitude 136, about 700 miles
            right west from Sydney, the same distance north-west from Van Diemen's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward of the colony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about 100 miles east from
            Port Lincoln. The colony is established under Parliamentary Commissioners, as an experiment, we believe, to try whether it may not be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration
            without any charge to the country, by selling lots of land at such a price as would defray the expense of conveying the emigrants from England. The plan adopted is, to send out preferably
            young married persons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts into the colony. A company has embarked t35,000 in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in March to
            examine the coast carefully, that the best site might be chosen at first, and the necessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male
            labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 females of a superior class. These numbers include 26 children. The Commissioners attempted at first to get 20s. per acre for the land ; but
            finding it impossible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country section of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they had raised
            the t35,000 required by the act of Parliament as the condition of the grant of land. We give these few details to put our readers in a condition to understand the notices which appear from
            time to time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the country a distinctive name. The title of "South Australia" is bad any way, and
            even positively absurd ; since Australia ( quasi Australasia,) originally intended for New Holland, has already begun to be monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district at Spencer's
            Gulf, if it is to participated in the general denomination, should be termed "North" rather than "South" Australia. By the way, most of our colonies in that quarter of the world have
            ridiculous names, as is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for the people out of them. What can be worse than a "Van Diemen-lander ;" a "New South-Wales-ian ;" a "Swan
            River-ite ;" or a "King-George's Soundian ! !"</p>

         <p>Highland Emigrants. –The ship " Midlothian" has just been fitted up at Leith for the reception of Highland emigrants, which she is to take in at the Isle of Skye for Sydney, New South
            Wales. These emigrants are, we believw, to be carried out at a very small cost to themselves, the largest portion of the passage money being paid by Government out of the land revenue of
            New South Wales, which is exclusively appropriated towards the encouragement and promotion of emigration–the objects in view being, as well the relief of those districts in this country
            which are suffering from the want of employment and subsistence, as by the introduction into that colony of a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant families and individuals, the
            promotion of the moral welfare of the colonists generally. The emigrants will, we believe, receive employment in New South Wales as farm-servants, shepherds, overseers, &amp;c. We had a
            brief inspection of the " Midlothian" on Monday afternoon, and found it to be a very fine vessel, fitted up in a manner the most comfortable and convenient that could well be effected. She
            sails this afternoon from Leith to the Isle of Skye.</p>

         <p>Thus the British Government is multiplying its colonies round the shores of New Holland. Exclusive of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a separate island, we have first on the eastern shore
            the old settlement of Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip, 500 miles south from Sidney ; a third just described, at St. Vincent's Gulf, 500 miles west from Port Philip ;
            a fourth at King George's Sound, 1100 miles west from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River, 250 miles north from King George's South. All these colonies are in the temperate zone,
            between the latitudes of 30 and 38, and will have nearly the same climate. We had one at Melville Island, on the north coast, within the torried zone, in latitude 12 ; but it was found to
            be very unhealthy, and was abandoned, after a short trial, ten years ago.</p>
         <p>Though the interior of New Holland, so far as hitherto explored, is one of the most barren and unpromising lands in the world, there is a margin of good soil round the greater part of its
            coasts, capabale [?] of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty millions of inhabitants; and there is little doubt that, in the course of three centuries, it will be the seat of a great and
            powerful nation, cultivating the arts, and speaking the language of Britain, and contributing powerfully to spread civilisation over the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

         <p>Emigration</p>
         <p>The Annual Report on Emigration just issued contains, besides the usual, correspondences and documents connected with the plan which has been some time in operation, of transferring
            labourers from India to the Mauritius, and which it is now proposed to extend to New South Wales. Leaving this subjest for the present, we shall state the general results[?] of the
            emigration to Canada.</p>
         <p>The Report shows, that the whole number of emigrants who landed at Quebec or Montreal, in the last nine years, was 259,788[?], averaging very nearly 29,000 per annum. The years of greatest
            emigration were 1831 and 1832, the numbers for these years being respectively 50,254 and 51,746. The proportions[?] [?] furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine years were as follows
            :–Among eight emigrants there were five Irishmen, two Englishmen, and one Scotsman. Scotland in proportion to its population has sent off three times as many emigrants, and Ireland about
            nine times as may as England; and it should be added, that a certain part of the emigration from England is artificial, consisting of paupers sent out at the expense of their parishes.
            Emigrations offers the most natural, practicable, and safe means of relieving a country of its redundant or unemployed population ; and it may be asked, why it is so much less resorted to
            in England than in Scotland and Ireland? It cannot[?] be the ignorance of the English, for this would lead to the inference that the Irish, who emigrate in the largest numbers, were the
            best informed of the three nations. It is, we apprehend, nothing but the Poor Laws, which hold out to the labourer the certainty of a subsistence at home, however idle or improvident he
            may be, and render him averse to live in the colonies, where he would have no such resource. This is only one of the many evils which these laws have produced, not only to the country at
            large, but to the labouring classes themselves, whose average condition was greatly deteriorated, while only a fraction of their number shared the benefit of the allowance. We speak of the
            Poor Laws as they existed before the Act of 1834 was passed.</p>
         <p>The number of emigrants who went to Canada last year was 21,901, of whom 1399 went from Scotland, 5580 from England, 14,538 from Ireland, and 274 from Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, or the
            West Indies. In 1836 the number of emigrants was 27,728. The ports in Scotland from which the greatest numbers sail are Greenock, Leith, Aberdeen, and Cromarty. Of the emigrants in 1837,
            4000 settled in Lower Canada, 16,300 in Upper Canada, 1500 went to the United States, and ninety-two died in the hospital or quarantine station.</p>
         <p>In the same period of nine years, 236,288[?] British emigrants have landed at new York, or fully 26,000 per annum on average. There is a great fluctua-[?] tion in the number. In 1833 and
            1835 it was only 16,000 ; in 1837 it was 34,000 ; in 1836 no less than 59,075 ; and addingthe 27,728 who went to Canada, no less than 86,800 persons must have landed at New York and Quebec
            from the British Isles in [?]. There is a discrepancy, however, between this account and another in a different Return, also newly published. The Report of the "Agent-General for
            Emigration," makes the number who went to the United States from Britain in 1836, only 37,774. The former probably comprehends all British born subjects, including persons from Nova
            Scotia, Canada, and the West Indies, and probably all passengers, many of whom returned.</p>
         <p>The Agent-General gives the number of persons who emigrated to the British Colonies and the United States for every year since 1825. We present merely the average for the last year seven
            years.</p>
         <p>Annual number of Emigrants from Britain to North American Colonies, 39[?],00 Ditto do. to United States, 34,[?]00 Ditto do. to Cape of Good Hope, 20[?] Ditto do. to Australian Colonies,
            3[?]0 73[?],[?]</p>
         <p>In 1832, the number who emigrated to these Colonies was no less than 103,140. The number who went out to Australia in 1837, was much greater than in any preceding year, being 5054.</p>
         <p>If we assume that each emigrant pays for his passage, &amp;c., or has in his pocket t30, the average net[?] expended on emigration will be about two millions per annum. It may be correctly
            stated now, that human beings form no inconsiderable item, in number and value, of our exports. In the case of Ireland we suppose it is by far the most flourishing, and by no means the
            least advantageous branch of the national commerce.</p>
         <p>The annual increment of the population of British Isles is about 330,000, independently of the efflux by emigration ; but including this, it must be about 420,000. It follows that there
            are about [?] more inhabitants in the country each day than there were on the day before. Of the 1150 additional mortals[?] emigration carries off 200.</p>
         <p>The establishment of steam navigation across the Atlantic will, no doubt, give a new impulse to the circulation of human beings, while the construction of railroads across the Alleganies,
            and of canals in Canada, will greatly increase the capacity of the western world to absorb the imported multitudes. In seven years hence, the journey from London to Missouri will be
            shorter in point of time, and perhaps cheaper, than the journey from Washington to Missouri was seven years ago. A religious man might see something like the finger of Providence in the
            fact, that just at the time France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant population, inventions have started into existence which
            may be said to annihilate space, and bring the most thinly inhabited parts of the world, into juxtaposition with the most overpeopled.</p>
         <p>From the American Almanac, we find that the number of passengers who arrived in the United States in 1836, was 81,000, of whom 4000 were native Americans. The proportion of emigrants from
            the different foreign countries was–</p>
         <p>From the British Isles, 47,792 ... British American Colonies, 2,681 ... Germany, 20,142 ... France, 4,443 ... Prussia, 563 ... Switzerland, 465 ... Denmark, 414 ... Holland, 298 ...
            Mexico, 797 ... Texas, 698 ... Cuba, 516 ... Other countries, 2,152</p>
         <p>Some curious inferences might be drawn from this table, as to the motives which induce men to leave their native country. Celeris paribus, there is most emigration where there is most
            intelligence. Thus, Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Naples, the Papal States, and Austria, furnish no emigrants to American, while Britain and Germany furnish a vast number. Much, however, must
            depend on the domestic condition of the country, and on the greater or less facilities for removing. Thus, considering its inland position, and the small number of its inhabitants, the
            spirit of emigration must be much more active in Switzerland, which sends out 445 persons, than in France, which sends out 4443.</p>
         <p>The magistrates of New York, it appears, consider the influx of emigrants a nuisance, and it would seem, from an expression of Mr Buchanan's, the agent at Quebec, that they had laid a tax
            of ten dollars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling. The key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in the following facts. A Board of Aldermen reported in June last, that
            the expense of City Almshouses in the preceding year were 205,500 dollars, or t44,000 ; that of 1209 persons admitted in a certain period, 932 were aliens ; and that the whole number under
            the charge of the Commissioners was 3074, of whom three-fourths were foreigners. A communication from the Mayor at the same time says:–" Nearly 2000 emigrants arrive each week ; our
            streets are filled with the wandering crowds of those passengers, clustering in our city, unaccustomed to our climate, without money, without employment, without friends, many not speaking
            our language, without any dependence for food, or rainment[?], or fireside." In Boston and Philadelphia, also, nearly one-half of the inmates of the almshouses were foreigners.</p>

            stimulating their flocks to revolt. The Prussian Government had, in consequence, increased its exertions to conciliate the Court of Rome, in hopes that its influence would be exercised
            over the clergy, and induce them to return to their allegiance. On the other hand, the sect of Separatists, who had resolved to emigrate from Austria to Australia, because of the
            interference of Government with their religious belief, amounted to 40,000 souls. It was said they would be joined by a great number of the inhabitants of Pomerania.</p>

         <p>Commission of the General Assembly</p>
         <p>On Wednesday, the Commission of Assembly met in the Tolbooth Church–Dr Muir, Moderator, in the chair.</p>
         <p>The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales. –The Moderator recalled to the notice of the Commission, that on a former meeting, they had directed him to write to Lord Glenelg, Secretary for
            the Colonies, disavowing connection with Dr Lang in New South Wales, and blaming his proceedings in that colony, in separating himself from the Presbytery there formed in connection with
            the Church of Scotland. Since that time he had had a communication from Lord Glenelg, which he was sure would be received by the Commission with great satisfaction.</p>
         <p>The communication from Lord Glenelg was then read. It consisted of a copy of the despatch transmitted to the Governor of New South Wales, approving of his conduct in withholding the
            salaries of the Presbyterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to the authority of the Presbytery in connection with the Church of Scotland, and further directing that Dr Lang's
            salary should be discontinued. His lordship explained, that in doing this the Government had no wish to constitute themselves judges in any ecclesiastical disputes ; but as the salaries
            awarded to these gentlemen had been given on the faith that they were to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland, they could not be continued so long as they defied her
            authority.</p>
         <p>On the motion of Mr Dunlop, the Commission unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the promptitude and decision which the Government had shown in the matter ; and directed the
            Moderator to communicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed to re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther proceedings, especially as it was understoof that Dr Lang
            was now on his way to this country.</p>
         <p>Case of Small Isles. –The Commission, then proceeded to take up the case of Small Isles, which, it will be recollected, arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean having, as was alleged, appeared in
            the lobby of the Assembly House, while that Court was sitting in May last, in a state of intoxication. The case occupied the Court a considerable part of the day; and at the evening
            sederunt the following motion, by Dr Gardner, was unanimously agreed to–That the Commission having considered the evidence on the record, find, that in as far as that evidence is hearsay,
            it is inadmissable; but find it proved that on the afternoon of Friday the 25th of May last, Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication in the vestibule of the General Assembly,
            attempting to force his way into it; that it is proved he was on two other occasions during the sitting of last Assembly in a state of intoxication; and, therefore, they find that he ought
            to be deposed from the office of the holy ministry, and direct the Moderator accordingly to pronounce the sentence of deposition, directing the Clerk to transmit an extract of the sentence
            to the Presbytery of Skye, and them to declare the parish of Small Isles vacant.–The Moderator pronounced from the chair the sentence os deposition.</p>
         <p>Case of Lethendy. –In the course of the proceedings during the early sederunt of the Commission, the Procurator rose and said, he might take the present opportunity of stating to the
            Commission, that within the last three or four days a petition and complaint had been given in to the Court of Session, and appointed to be served, at the instance of Mr Clark, presentee
            to the parish of Lethendy, against the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Mr Kessen, whom that Presbytery had lately inducted into that charge, in despite of interdicts issued by the Court of
            Session. He mentioned the fact to that Commission, presuming that they would authorize him to defend the Presbytery, who had acted under authority of the Commission itself.</p>
         <p>Mr Buchanan of Glasgow, after some remarks in commendation of the firmness of the Presbytery in carrying through the settlement amidst many difficulties, moved that "The Commission
            sanction the Procurator's defending the Presbytery in the trying circumstances in which they are placed, and resolve that they will to the utmost of their power encourage and support them
            under whatsoever difficulties they may be subjected by their execution of the sentence of the Commission ; and that the thanks of the Commission be given to the Presbytery for the decision
            and temperate firmness with which they have practically maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of the Church."</p>
         <p>Dr Bryce said, he was quite unprepared for any motion on this subject; but with the views which he entertained in regard to this case, it was impossible he could concur in the motion
            proposed, and he must therefore dissent from it.</p>
         <p>Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against Mr Clark for thus bidding defiance to the authority of the Church Courts, and he proposed, that for thus trampling on the rights and
            dignity of the Church, Mr Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission for an exemplary punishment.–Mr Dunlop suggested, that although he concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges, it
            would be premature at present to take any steps against Mr Clark, inasmuch as there was no official communication on the subject from the Presbytery of Dunkeld.</p>
         <p>Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges, for this reason, not to press his motion, declaring, that as at this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had been deposed, he trusted the time was not
            far distant when Mr Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; and Mr M. said emphatically, that whatever the Presbytery of Dunkeld might suffer for upholding the
            independence of the Church, he, as a member of Commission, by whose orders they had acted, would be proud to bear his share.</p>
         <p>Mr bridges then intimated, that he would waive pressing his motion, and Mr Buchanan's was adopted, Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their dissent, on the ground that it was
            incompetent and inexpedient for the Commission to adopt such a resolution.</p>
         <p>Commemoration of the Second Centenary of the Celebrated Assembly at Glasgow. –In the course of the day, the Moderator suggested, that as this was the second centenary of the great Assembly
            at Glasgow, which might be considered as the founder, not only of their ecclesiastical but of their civil liverties, a meeting should be held, exclusively devoted to prayer and
            thanksgiving to Almighty God for the benefits conferred on their Zion.</p>
         <p>At seven o'clock accordingly, several of the members, and a considerable number of people assembled, when an hour was spent in devotional exercises, which were conducted by Drs Muir, Lee,
            and Dickson, in succession.</p>
         <p>The Commission adjourned to the second Tuesday in February next.</p>

         <p>Daryanthus Excelsa –This most magnificent and gigantic plant is now in full bloom in one of the hothouses at Dunkeld gardens. It is a native of New South Wales, and to be met with in this
            country in very few collections–this being the third plant of the kind that has flowered in Great Britain. It is one of the four plants which were sent from New Holland to the Duchess of
            Atholl, twelve years ago, and the only one that has survived the voyage. The seapus or stem is upwards of twelve feet in heigh, from the top of which diverge seven stalks, each bearing
            nine large flowers of a deep crimson and pink colour. The formation of the stalks and outer petals of the flower, remind one of the Crinum Amabile, but much larger. We had no communication
            as a guide to its culture, but kept it at all times, and in all season, associated with the most hardy green-houseplants.– Dunkeld Gardens, 24th May.</p>
         <p>By the death of Sir James Montgomery, the office of Presenter of Signatures in Scotland has become vacant. We understand that this office is no longer to be conducted by deputy.</p>
         <p>On Thursday the 23d ult. the United Associate Congregation, Kendal, gave a unanimous call to Mr William Ritchie, preacher, to be their pastor.</p>

         <p>Meeting on Emigration in Dublin. –One of the largest and msot influential meetings that we ever remember, says the Dublin Monitor of Thursday, took place on Wednesday, at the Rotunda, to
            form an Association for the Promotion of Emigration to South Australia. In rank and numbers it was not surpassed. There could not be less than two thousand persons in the room. Colonel
            Torrens dwelt at considerable length on the causes of Irish misery, and proved fully, at least to our satisfaction, that a powerful and efficacious remedy was applicable in the objects of
            the meeting. The subject seemed to tell powerfully on the meeting ; the speakers were heard with great attention, and the applauses they received told that the public feeling was deeply
            identified with the future colony of New Ireland.</p>

         <p>A Man Shot. –On Tuesday evening a deliverate attempt at murder by shooting took palce at Greenock. A young man from Edinburgh, an intended emigrant for New South Wales, by the Palmyra,
            drew from his pocked a pistol, and shot in the head a person who had been appointed by his friends to see him on board, and to look to his affairs before the sailing of the vessel. The
            wounded man was taken to the Infirmary in a very dangerous state, and the assailant to the jail. It appears that the young man has for some time past been behaving in a manner which made
            his friends chary of intrusting him with money in this country, and that they had employed the individual referred to, to see him on board for Australia, before leaving any under his
            charge. This indignity is supposed to have lain heavy on his mind, and led to the commission of the act above recorded.– Ibid.</p>

         <p>First Scotch Colony for New Zealand – A numerous party of emigrants, under this title, are now making the necessary arrangements for embarking in the Bengal Merchant, to sail from Greenock
            in September. The committee for the west of Scotland, and their agents, are now employed in selecting eligible persons as settlers, and, judging from the number of applications, the
            directors will be called on to send a second vessel from the Clyde. A clergyman of the Scotch Church, who accompanies the colony, will officiate as chaplain on board. It is intended that
            the Clude shall be made the principal shipping port of Scotland for New Zealand, and that the strictest regulations shall be put in force in order to ensure the comfort, safety, and
            convenience of the passengers.– New Zealand Gazette.</p>

         <p>Selected Poetry</p>
         <p>The Woodland, By the Late Robert Nicoll.</p>
         <p>The woodland wild ! – wilt thou go with me, Where the squirrel is perchen on his oaken tree,– where the yellow fern doth wave its head,– Where the hands of night the dew hath laid,– And
            the winds, that wander to and fro, Kiss the brown leaflets as they go,– Where the morning sun peeps in, so mild, To the dark green nooks of the woodland wild ? The woodland wild ! –where
            the dun deer roam, And the song-birds build them a happy home,– Where the grass is green, and the turf so sweet, Seems shorn by the tread of fairy feet,– Where the daylight comes, so
            richly dim, And the cushat's coo seems a hermit's hymn, The care-worn heart might be self-beguiled To forget its woes in the woodland wild ! The woodland wild ! –where the hazels grow,
            Where the ladye-broom doth its branches throw,– Where the God-built sky is in patches seen Through the roof of leaves. There aye hath been The home of those wild and fairy flowers That
            gladden all Nature's life and ours, As they bloom by the stream,–that prattling child, That wanders along through the woodland wild ! The woodland wild !–If thy heart be pure, If thy faith
            in the right be firm and sure, Go, wander the woodlands parth within, And the love of Nature woo and win; Drink of the cup of beauty there, Where the breath of Omnipotence scents the air;
            For the Father of beauty in love hath smiled On the sweet green bowers of the woodland wild The woodlan wild !–long, long ago, I have buried myself its leaves below, And dreamed of its
            beauteous tenants all,– 'Tis the linnet's home and fairies' hall! 'Tis the spot where the wondrous monk of old, His hermitage reared in the pleasant wold; By its door a crystal springlet
            boiled, For the pilgrim to drink, in the woodlan wild! The woodland wild !–what pleasant stories Make sunlight over its olden glories,– Of Robin Hood and his bowmen bold, The raids they
            made, and the tales they told ! In winter, in spring, and in summer time, The glorious forests are aye in prime ; For glad thoughts forever are round them piled, Those grassy glades in the
            woodland wild! The woodland wild!–make haste.–make haste! Away with me, and its gladness taste; We will wander beside each gushing stream, Where flowers in the water reflected gleam; We
            will follow its paths and pluck its flowers, And lie on its grass in the evening hours, Till the dying sunlight, soft and mild, Warns us away from the woodland wild ! Tail's Magazine</p>
         <p>Song of the Emigrants to New Zealand Steer, helmsman, till you steer our way By stars beyond the line– We go to found a realm–one day– Like England's self to shine. Chorus. Cheer up !
            Cheer up! our course we'll keep With dauntless heart and hand, And when we've ploughed the stormy deep We'll plough a smiling land. A land whose beauties importune The Briton to its
            bowers, To sow but plenty's seeds and prune Luxuriant fruits and flowers, Chorus –Cheer up ! cheer up ! There tracts uncheered[?] by human words, Seclusion's wildest holds, Shall hear the
            lowing of our herds, The tinkling of our folds, Chorus –Cheer up ! cheer up ! Like rubies set in gold shall blush Our vineyards girt with corn, And wine, and oil, and gladness gush From
            Amalthea's horn. Chorus –Cheer up ! cheer up ! Britannia's pride is in our hearts, Her blood is in our veins, We'll girdle earth with British arts, Like Ariel's magic chains, Chorus. Cheer
            up ! cheer up ! our course we'll keep With dauntless heart and hand, And when we've ploughed the stormy deep We'll plough a smiling land. T. Campbell London, 16th August, 1839.</p>

         <p>Thursday afternoon the splendid ship Indus, which has been some time in the docks, sailed with a full cargo and about sixty settlers, for Port Adelaide and Philip, South Australia. The
            Indus has been fitted up in that style of elegance and comfort, for which the agents, Messrs Broadfoot and Son, are so celebrated. The passengers consist of a number of respectable
            individuals of various professions, the greater bulk of whom are agricultural labourers, sent out by Messrs Adamson and Co., agents for her Majesty's Commissioners in South Australia.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday forenoon a man fell from the deck of the Royal William steam-ship, and had his thighbone broken, and was otherwise seriously bruised. He was carried to the Dispensary Rooms,
            but upon examining the nature of his injuries, the medical attendants recommended his removal to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.</p>

         <p>Church in New South Wales. –Dr Gordon, as Convener of the committee to whom the dissensions that at present existed among the Presbyterian churches in Australia had been remitted by last
            Commission, stated that the Committee had prepared a report ; but that since it was made up, several important documents had come to hand, which, in justice to Dr Lang, ought to be
            considered. He therefore asked leave to delay the report, and to have the matter, with these documents, recomitted to the committee.–This motion was agreed to, on the understanding that
            the question would be again taken up at the meeting of the Commission on the 11th December.</p>

         <p>Afflicting Case of Destitution. –Some time ago a vessel was advertised to sail from this port for Australia, and to take out Government settlers free of expense. A family in Shetland,
            consisting of the husband, wife, and six of a young family, sold off their effects and came to Leith for the purpose of availing themselves of this opportunity to settle in the above
            colony. On applying to the agent, however, they were informed that they did not come under the description of persons wanted. Since, therefore, they have lived in Leith till their little
            all has been exhausted, and the husband, from the combined effects of disappointment and want, has been thrown upon a sick-bed, and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation.
            Several private individuals, with a benevolence that does them the highest credit, have temporarily supplied their wants ; but the hands of private charity is soon crippled, and unless
            something else be immediately done, we may have soon to report one or more of their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of life. The object of the present notice therefore is to
            draw forth the sympathies of the charitable, to relive a family thus suddenly involved in want and misery, who, from their industrious habits and every way excellent characters, left their
            native home with the good wishes of all their friends. Any donations, either in money or clothes, will be thankfully received by Mr Andrew Spence, of the firm of Messrs Cunninham &amp;
            Spence, No. 62, Tolbooth-wynd, Leith.</p>

         <p>New Zealand.–On Wednesday a public meeting was held in the Guildhall of the city of London, pursuant to a requisition to the Lord Mayor, for the purpose of petitioning her Majesty and both
            Houses of Parliament " to adopt prompt and efficient measures for preserving from invasion or abandonment the longestablished sovereignty of the British Crown in the islands of New
            Zealand, at present endangered by foreign pretensions, and by the acts of the Executive Government ; also for stopping the course of lawless emigration and settlement, which has not only
            proved deeply injurious to the native people of the country, but threatens their speedy extermination ; and, lastly, for establishing the most beneficial system of colonization, and the
            protection and restraints of British law, under a distinct colonial government, in place of the state of anarchy which now prevails among both races, and all other classes of her Majesty's
            subjects, and others inhabiting or resorting to New Zealand, as a distant independency of the territory of New South Wales." Including the gentlemen of the hustings, the entire number
            might be calculated at 400 individuals. The Lord Mayor took the chair. Resolutions in accordance with the object of the meeting were moved and seconded by Mr G. Palmer, M.P., Mr F. Baring,
            M.P., Mr Hawes, M.P., Mr G. F. Young, Mr Ward, M.P., and others. On the motion of Mr G. Robinson, seconded by Mr Donaldson, a petition was adopted by the meeting, to be presented to the
            Queen by the Earl of Devon, to the House of Peers by Lord Ashburton, and to the Commons by Lord Eliot.</p>

         <p>New Zealand–Name of the Capital City. ?It will gratify the admirers of the Duke of Wellington to learn, that the Directors of the New Zealand Company have resolved that the name of the
            city founded by Colonel Wakefield, Lambton Harbour, Port Nicholson, and which is destined to become the capital of New Zealand, shall be named "The City of Wellington," in honour of the
            illustrious Duke. The Duke is a great advocate for colonization, and to him the promoters of colonization of South Australia were in a great measure indebted for securing the enactment of
            the statute which gave effect to the principles on which that colony is founded ; and, as many of the promoters of South Australian emigration are Directors of the New Zealand Company,
            they have resolved, setting all party politics aside, to confer this honour on the Duke. There could be no stronger proof of the political sagacity and statesmanlike views of the Duke,
            than his approval of the Wakefield system of colonization, and no better mode of perpetuating his name than by bestowing it on the metropolis of the "Great Britain of the Southern
            Hemisphere."</p>

         <p>Deputation of Distressed Weavers. –The distress of the Paisley weavers has caused them to send a deputation to London, which, on Tuesday, waited on Lord John Russell, to solicit the means
            of transporting themselves out of the ungrateful country which has been enriched by their toils, and, in return, refuses them the means of subsistence. Their prayer was to be sent to New
            Zealand. The answer was, that Government will, next session, bring forward some general measure on the subject, but in the mean time cannot help them.</p>

         <p>Literature</p>
         <p>Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round The Globe &amp;c. &amp;c By Frederick Debell Bennett, Esq., F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: Richard Bentley.</p>
         <p>We have been somewhat disappointed in these volumes. We expected to have found them, like Scoresby's, full of interesting details regarding whale fishing, whereas, there is hardly a word
            on the subject throughout the whole of the first volume, and very little in the second ; in fact, what there is, is confined to a sort of supplementary appendix. This is the more strange,
            that one of the chief purposes of the author, as he himself informs us, in undertaking this voyage, was to investigate the anatomy and habits of southern whales, and the mode of conducting
            the sperm whale fishery, subjects which, he remarks, were then untouched by the literature of any country. Yet, in the work itself, this chief purpose dwindles into one of very secondary
            prominence. This, the readers of the work, at least most of them, will the more regret, on finding how very curious and interesting are the two or three chapters which the author has given
            on the subject of South Sea whaling. There are full of entertaining details of both a popular and scientific character, and cannot be read without exciting a wish that larger portion of
            the work had been composed of such material.</p>
         <p>In making these remarks, however, we are far from intending to depreciate the sort of information, in the shape chiefly of sketches of the South Sea Islands, to which the greater part of
            the volumes are devoted ; we mean merely to say, that it is not what we expected from the title of the work, nor, we may add, what, for our own reading, we should have preferred. Yet are
            these sketches very amusing reading–full of graphic descriptions and curious details of native character, which is still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of very primitive
            simplicity. "We have frequently seen," says Mr Bennett, " amongst the congregagation assembled at Church (in Raiatea), a native clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a beaver hat
            surmounting a person naked except the scanty maro ; and a third, whose whole attire was a black coat, white neckerchief, and a shirt!"</p>
         <p>We observe a rather odd circumstance noted by Mr Bennett. He says that the " temperate ships" of America are the principal purveyors of ardent spirits to the natives of the South Sea
            Islands, carrying large quantities of rum thither for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the temperance principle in a somewhat curious predicament.</p>
         <p>Another remark of the author's not less striking–mark it well and take comfort from it ye bon vivants[?] of the civilzed world–is, that disease is as abundant amongst the native islanders
            as amongst the most refined of their species, and from this concludes, that man in his savage state is as liable to the " ills that flesh is heir to," as in his civilised condition. Dr
            Johnson made a similar remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; alleging that the London alderman lived as long over his turtle feast, as the Highlander over his paten cake. What
            degree of fellow-feeling with civic dignitary and his good living, or whether any, dictated this remark of the learned doctor, we cannot say.</p>
         <p>Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability, and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a tendency, occasionally, to the use of rather learned phraseology.</p>
         <p>We conclude with an extract from that portion of the work which, from its great interest, we regretted was not larger, but which, limited as it is, is so full of curious information, and
            so crowded with remarkable incident, as to render the selection by no means an easy task.</p>
         <p>"Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ their tail when attacked, but prove active and dangerous with their jaws. Such individuals often rather seek than avoid the attacking boats,
            and, rushing upon them with open mouth, employ every possible art to crush them with their teeth, and, if successful, will sometimes continue in their neighbourhood, biting the wreck and
            oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a boat, the whale usually turns and swings upon its back, and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unaccountable manner, keeping its
            formidable lower jaw suspended for some moments over the boat, in a threatening attitude, but ultimately rolling to one side, and closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe
            this whale, when pursued and attacked, retain[?] its mouth in an expanded state for some minutes together. Such threatening demonstrations of the jaw, as well as some others with the
            flukes, occasionally compel a boat's crew to leap into the water, and support themselves by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has passed.</p>
         <p>"In the year 1835, the ship Pusie Hall encountered a fighting whale, which after injuring and driving off her four boats, pursued them to the ship, and withstood for some time the lances
            hurled at it, by the crew, from the bows of the vessel, before in could be induced to retire ; in this affair a youth in one of the boats was destroyed by a blow from the whale, and one of
            the officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact with the animal's jaw.</p>
         <p>"A highly tragical instances of the power and ferocity occasionally displayed by the sperm whale, is recorded in the fate of the American South-Seaman Essex, Captain G. Pollard. This
            vessel, when cruising in the Pacific Ocean, in the year 1820, was wrecked by a whale under the following extraordinary circumstances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a school of
            whales, and the ship was attending them to windward. The master and second mate were engaged with whales they had harpooned, in the midst of the school, and the chief mate had returned on
            board to equip a spare boat, in lieu of his own, which had been broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew were thus occupied, the look-out at the masthead reported that a large
            whale was coming rapidly down upon the ship, the mate hastened his task, in the hope that he might be ready in time to attack it.</p>
         <p>"The Cachalot, which was of the largest size, consequently a male, and probably the guardian of the school, in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely, that the although the helm was
            put up to avoid the contact, he struck her a severe blow, which broke off a portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then observed to retire to some distance, and again rush upon the
            ship with extreme velocity. His enormous head struck the starboard bow, beating in a corresponding portion of the planks, and the people on board had barely time to take to their boats,
            before the ship filled with water and fell over on her side. She did not sink, however, for some hours ; and the crew in the boats continued near the wreck until they had obtained a small
            supply of provisions, when they shaped a course for land ; but here, it is to be regretted, they made a fatal error. At the time the accident happened they were cruising on the Equator, in
            the longitude of about 118[?] degrees West, with the Marquesan and Society Islands on their lee, and might have sailed in their boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short
            time. Under an erroneous impression, however, that all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race of people, they preferred pulling to windward for the coast of Peru, and in the
            attempt were exposed for a lengthened period in extreme privations."</p>
         <p>A few Cachalots have been noted individually as animals dangerous to attack. One was thus distinguished on the cruising ground off the coast of New Zealand, and was long know to whalers by
            the name of 'New Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of great size, conspicuously distinguished by a white hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made amongst the boats and gear of ships
            attempting his destruction. A second example, of cimilar celebrity, was known to whalers in the Straits of Timor. He had so often succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as to be
            considered invincible, but was at length despatched by a whaler, who, forewarned of his combative temper, adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea, to withdraw his attention
            from the boats ; but notwithstanding this ruse the animal was not destroyed without much hard fighting, nor until the bow of one of the boats had been nipped off by his jaws."</p>

         <p>Emigration to New Zealand– The Chartists Again.</p>
         <p>( From the Glasgow Argus..</p>
         <p>On Monday night a public meeting, chiefly composed of the working classes, was held in the Justiciary Court Hall, Glasgow, for the purpose of memorializing Lord John Russell in favour of
            obtaining the Lord Provost in the chair. The hall was crowded to excess, and it was perfectly evident from the first that the Chartists had mustered in great strength to carry out their
            usual course of obstruction to the particular business of the evening.–Mr T. Gillespie proposed a resolution in favour of emigration to New Zealand through the medium of funds raised by
            the sale of lands in the colony, and addressed the meeting at some length in support of the resolution.–Mr R. Malcolm, jun. a young lad, and a Chartist spouter, after a long speech,
            proposed an amendment; to the effect that while the meeting was favourable to emigration to New Zealand, or any other part of the world, by those so disposed, they objected to any
            application being made for a grant of public money for any such purpose–that they were opposed to the question of emigration being allowed to occupy public attention, &amp;c. and concluded
            with the statement that emigration would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed operatives, and that bad laws were the chief cause of all their present sufferings, &amp;c. This
            amendment which was supported by the most trifling arguments we ever heard brought forward in public, was of course loudly cheered by the Chartists. The Lord Provost repeatedly explained
            that he had agreed to take the chair on the understanding that the subject of emigration to New Zealand was to occupy the attention ; but here a matter, perfectly foreign to the business
            for which they were convened, was introduced by way of amendment ; there was an attack made upon the general policy of the country–and he had positively to state that, if such an amendment
            was carried, he would not remain in the chair. This was received by cries for "a new chairman" and much confusion, one party cheering, and the other hissing and yelling alternately during
            the greater part of the evening. A discussion followed, in which a boy named Jack took a prominent part ; and it became perfectly evident that the Chartist speakers were woefully ignorant
            of the subject they had the impudence to discuss. It was gravely and indignantly averred, that by going to New Zealand, the working men would incur the risk of being swallowed by
            cannibals! Till informed of the contrary, the Chartists seemed to think that the means of emigration were to be supplied from the public exchequer ; and when told that the funds were to be
            raised by the sale of lands in New Zealand, one of them sagely observed that it would be much more humane and just to appropriate the proceeds of those sales of land to employ it in
            sending out emigrants ! Another favourite argument was, that every person had a right to subsist in the land that gave him birth, and that it was barbarous and cruel to send a man, however
            wretched, out of his native country ; also, that emigration would produce no benefit to society at home, as the places of those sent off would soon be filled by others. Of course, if these
            arguments had always been held good, and acted upon, the whole human family would, to this day, have been crowded together in the cradle of our race in the East, provided only the thing
            had been possible; the extension of mankind to other parts of the world must have been wicked, and cruel, and useless–for "for every inhabitant of a country is entitled to a subsistence in
            the land that gave him birth," and, on his removal to another land, his place would just be filled by others ! The above is a mere specimen of the worse than childish arguments used by the
            Chartist spouters, and which the men who are now " knocking loudly at the door of the constitution for admission," cheered as if they had been fraught with the choicest wisdom !–Mr John
            Crawford, Secretary to the New Zealand Land Company, endeavoured, by some sensible remarks, to place the question of emigration to New Zealand on its proper footing ; but in vain ; they
            were determined to have the charter only–and till then starving workmen, willing, but unable, to emigrate, must starve on. On a division, the amendment proposed by Mr Malcolm was carried
            by a large majority, and, after a vote of thanks had been given to the Lord Provost, the meeting broke up. This was not done, however, till the Chartists were called upon to be at their
            posts at the meeting to be held to-day to address the Queen–to render themselves, of course, a little more odious by another stretch of their obstructive power–if they can.</p>

         <p>On Monday a discussion of some interest took place in the House of Commons relative to the affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain defects in its government, that colony has fallen
            into a state of financial embarassment requiring immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the history of the settlement from its foundation, and stated that, while its revenue does not
            exceed t20,000 its expenditure has increased to the enormous sum of t130,000 a year ! At present its affairs are managed by commissioners, the responsible Ministers of the Crown having no
            direct control over its expenditure. This is manifestly an evil, and must form the subject of future legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to provide for the payment of certain
            bills now over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell proposed that her Majesty should be authorized to guarantee a loan of t210,000 for this purpose. Lord Stanley concurred generally in the
            views of the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though that the Government ought not to demand a loan until they had brought in a bill to explain distinctly the principles on which they
            proposed that the colony should henceforth be governed. Sir Robert Peel suggested that the Government should ask a vote of credit for the sum required, which, as it met the urgency of the
            case, was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was deferred till Friday.</p>

         <p>New South Wales</p>
         <p>Mr Grote rose to move a series of resolutions in condemnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emigration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of gaols and police in that
            colony. It was in 1831 that this expense, antecedently borne by the Home Government, was for the first time thrown upon the colony, whose revenues were then found to yield considerable
            surplus of revenue beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was calculated to be about t25,000 a year ; and had that been all the colony would have borne it without a murmur;
            but in fact it had ever since averaged nearly t60,000. It was not reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony, on account of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary uses of a
            colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our transportation system. The argument urged by the Home Government was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive
            distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so assigned. But that assignment was a gain, not more to the
            colonists, who obtained the labour, than to the mother country, which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers. Whatever value the mother country might be entitled to claim for the
            labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium from them,
            still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon the colony at large. That was to pay private wages out of public rates. This one charge on the oclony was sufficient on account for all
            that embarassment in its finances which had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled to defray the impact, only by resorting to the emigration fund, and thus checking
            emigration itself. No less than t260,000 had been abstracted from that fund to meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that fund from emigration was a great evil, both to
            the colony, where labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this country, to whom that refuge is so material. He considered the emigration fund as held by the Government in trust
            for the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country. The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been [?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed[?] would
            be applied to emigration.</p>
         <p>The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of various persons in favour of this strict application, when a motion was made to count the House, and it adjourned for want of its
            quorum[?] of 40 members.</p>

      <texto>
         <p>We have received a copy of a Series of Resolutions passed, on the 23d of October 1840, by the Legislative Council of New South Wales, on the subject of immigration into colony. The object
            of these resolutions is to encourage emigration from the mother country, by showing the demand for labour in New South Wales, and the advantages offered to the immigrant. We have only room
            for a few of the more important resolutions :</p>
         <p>Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony an urgent and increasing want of working hands, in every branch of industry ; that there is ample employment for emigrants, at highly
            renumerating wages without the interruption, in this mild climate, experienced in colder countries during the winter months ; and that, even during the worst period of the past severe
            drought, no persons able and willing to work found any difficult in procuring advantageous employment.</p>
         <p>Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there can be no more advantageous field for the employment of industry than is presented in New South Wales– experience proving, that
            able-bodied, sober, industrious and careful emigrants may, within a few years after their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers to be themselves employers of labour; by which
            process, and by the progressive increase of the flocks and herds of the colony, a constant demand for additional labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehension of a dearth of
            employment for as many as may arise.</p>
         <p>Resolved. That this Council would particularly instance the large and increasing sums at the credit of the working classes in the Savings Bank of New South Wales, as affording gratifying
            evidence of their prosperous condition, the deposits having increased from t24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to t127,000 on 31st August 1840.</p>
         <p>Resolved. That great additional advantage must accrue to the mother country from the large consumption in this colony of British produce and manufactures, the declared value of which, from
            1826 to 1839, according to the official returns for that period, amounted to more than eight millions sterling, having progressively increased from t280,000, the amount in 1826, to
            t1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports from the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, increased from t106,600 in the former year, to t948,776 in the latter–the total amount
            being t6,187,530 for the whole period.</p>
         <p>Resolved. That the trade between the mother country and this colony, together with the whale fisheries in the adjourning seas, also affords a valuable nursery for seamen, important in this
            respect, in proportion to the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that this field for the employment of British shipping must
            increase with the growing prosperity of the colony– considerations which appear to this Council to constitute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony, to the fostering care of
            the British Government.</p>

         <p>Emigration to New Zealand. –On Friday the Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the river on her voyage to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she takes
            out 50 mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of other passengers, amongst whom are Mr Swainson, Chief Justice, and Mr
            Martin, Attorney-General, of the new colony, to which sations they have been recently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort of the emigrants on board were certainly very complete ;
            and it must be gratifying to know that those persons sent out by the company will be provided with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a great quantity of patent preserved
            provisions being shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There are a greater number of children than usual in the Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of from eight to
            twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, which now lies in the London Dock, will clear out on the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty well clear the depot of its present
            inmates.</p>

         <p>New Zealand Company</p>
         <p>A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Friday, off the West India Dock entrance, at Blackwall, by the preparation for departure of three fine vessels with "improvers" for
            "Nelson," the second colony of New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and several hundred persons of rank and wealth met there to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants, who
            appeared highly delighted with the honour extended to them, and in high spirits with the anticipations of the successful result of their mission. After viewing the arrangeents made for the
            comfort of all on board, the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern, where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large room. The Duke of Sussex took the chair, and was
            supported on the right by the Earl of Devon, and on the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Company. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inverness, the Duke and Duchess of
            Somerset, Lords Cottenham, Sandon, Marcus Hill, Clements, Viscount Ebrington, M.P., the Hon. Frederick Dundas, Hon. Captain Drummon, Messrs P. Maxwell Stewart, M.P., Gowen, G. F. Young, W.
            C. Young, and the Misses Young; the Hon. Mrs Douglas, the Hon. Miss Petre, Rev, Dr Hinds, J. E. Boulcott, Captain Hine, Sir Robert and Lady Harland, Sir John Doxatt, M. D.; Mr, Mrs, and
            Miss Pennington; Lieutenant Lean, her Majesty's Emigration Agent; MEssrs Jordan, E. G. Wakefield, Dudley Costello, Mr and Mrs S. C. Brees, Captain Sinclair, R.N.,&amp;c. &amp;c. The rapid
            progress which the grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand has made, was more than once alluded to by his Royal Highness and other distinguished speakers on both sides of politics, and
            its many advantages were dwelt upon with much sincerity of feeling. Several gentlemen of the first families go out with this expedition, which will be closely followed by several
            first-rate ships.</p>

         <p>A Return, just published, shows that emigration is still proceeding upon a gigantic scale:–</p>
         <p>Emigrants from the United Kingdom in 1840. England. Scotland. Ireland. Total. To North American colonies, 5,303 3,053 23,935 32,293 United States, 35,309 1,246 4,087 40,0 Other parts of

         <p>We have not the previous Returns at hand, but we believe that a larger number of emigrants never left the shores of the British Isles in one year than the above. It is startling to think,
            that 1800 persons quit the kingom every week never to return. The natural increase of the people must be about 1100 per day, of whom emigration carries off 250, leaving 850 to swell the
            Census.</p>
         <p>The emigration to our North American colonies was as follows:–</p>

         <p>Theatre Royal. –The Pantomine, we observe, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the theatre is crowded nightly, the public being admitted at second price from the commencement of the
            performances.</p>
         <p>Music Hall. –We stated, about two month ago, that, in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now happy
            to announce, that at a meeting of the proprietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were given to the Directors to take the requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The
            desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid hall, constructed with a due regard to the accommodation both of professional men
            and the public, and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements, by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a grand scale. By what may be called
            a propitious coincidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this resolution was come to.</p>
         <p>Martin's Paintings. –The exhibition of these celebrated paintings in this city has already, we believe, attracted many visitors. They are truly wonderful creations, and possess a power and
            grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar to the public, convey but a faint conception. In contemplating " the Deluge," the spectator is so [?] [?] [?] the scene, that he is apt to
            overlook the details; but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, while
            everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures–"Pandemonium" and "the Rivers of Bliss," are smaller in size, but equally indicative of
            the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to each other–the one fearful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a
            heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this collection, amongst which is "The Offering Up of Isaac," a
            Rembrandt in fine preservation.</p>
         <p>Gordon's British Diorama. –This beautiful exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we understand, been crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in
            to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of London during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now arrived, and is being exhibited along with the other
            views.</p>
         <p>Broughton-place Congregation.–We understand that the call given by BroughtonPlace Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon, Sanquhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown, has not been accepted,
            owing to the strong claims which the affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of his services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a charge so laborious; a
            result which, we learn, has caused among the members of Broughton-Place extreme and general regret.</p>
         <p>Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre, Leith. –Mr Cooke has generously handed over to the Provost, for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society, the handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds
            of Friday evening's entertainment, which took place under the patronage of the Provost and Magistrates.</p>
         <p>Captain Ross' Discoveries. –Extracts from Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper. From the map which accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct idea of
            his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?] afforded. South Victoria Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is
            unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163 and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand, and at the distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the
            part seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice
            150 feet high, which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice at 66. The land " rose in lofy
            peaks from 9000 to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with eternal snow; the glaciers descended from near the mountain summits, project many miles into the ocean, and presented a
            perpendicular face of lofty cliffs." They could not reach the mainland, but landed on an island, which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, in latitude 77 1/2,
            longitude 169 E., they discovered a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion," and named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the other
            vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward, they had soundings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt,
            reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet above water, must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet of thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the
            South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it, though their nearest approach to it was a point
            160 miles from it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole is probably within that region, though this cannot be positively affirmed, as its western boundary is unknown. The highest
            latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful of their predecessors. The
            Non-intrusion Disclosures. –In the Advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from J. M. Hog, Esq. of Newliston, and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton, both expressing their
            extreme surprise at the letter of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last), and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee.</p>
         <p>Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. –We understand that the Government of Prussia, thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax, recently
            sent over a person to this country, to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily, the very first specimens of our piety which met him were
            the sweetie case, and that of the poor man Key who was excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural
            fruits of our system, and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that the fame
            of their exploits has already travelled, by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to the uttermost parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and
            the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity.</p>
         <p>Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference. – On Monday last, the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws, met, in compliance with the
            request of the Committee taking the active management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in January next on that subject, when they unanimously appointed their
            pastor, the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin, A.M., Mr John Craig Waddell, proprietor, and Mr James Forrester, merchant in Airdrie, to represent their sentiments at that meeting, which is looked
            forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor, with Messrs Adam Nimmo, contractor, and John Young, bookseller, will represent
            the Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir, pastor of the Baptist church, will represent that body on that occasion.</p>
         <p>Kirkcudbright–Address to the Dean of Faculty, –We learn that at a meeting, held on the 17th current, of the Clerks and Procurators of the Steward and COmmissary Courts, an address was
            voted to Alexander Wood, Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty, and his retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright.</p>
         <p>Distress in Paisley. –We understand that the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few days, the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee
            for the distressed weavers in Paisley.</p>
         <p>Musselburgh. –Mr Wilson, Treasurer to the "Honest Town," has, by the hands of the district committeesm collected from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund, nearly t100; and the
            committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the necessitous families in the neighbourhood.</p>
         <p>Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of Mr Monroe. –This Presbytery met on Tuesday the 21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr Monroe, presentee to Fala, and laid on the table of
            Presbytery a presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been objected that the presentation, and some other papers relative thereton, bore, that Mr Monroe was presented
            merely to the parish of Fala, and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra, the agent made his appearance again at the meeting, which was held on Tuesday, with a supplementary
            presentation, and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent, when asked, admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated, that he would not ask the
            Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated, that he intended to appear at the next meeting, which is appointed to be held on the 22d of
            February, and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents.</p>
         <p>Splendid Meteor. –On Tuesday evening, about eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The evening was very clear, the sky being without a cloud,
            and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills, the Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth and
            air on every side as far as the eye could reach, with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong shape, and apparently almost twice the size
            of the moon, having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary, but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat
            resembling that of a rocket, but composed of the most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind it for a short distance, adding much to its spendour, and giving the whole an appearance
            at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appearance, and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and
            dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass from the south to the north, inclining towards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another
            meteor of the same kind, but much less in size, brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south, a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence
            worthy of notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with that first described in the above, was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.– Stirly Journal.</p>
         <p>Glasgow. –The collection made on Sabbath afternoon last, by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation, Nicholson Street, Glasgow, amounted to t46, 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy
            when it is considered that this congregation has within a few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful place of worship to be called "Erskine
            Church," of which they are erelong to take possession.</p>
         <p>The Unemployed in Paisley.–The number of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official
            report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :–</p>
         <p>Paisley. Males, 1865 Dependants, 4662 –6527 Females, 1680 Dependants, 3360 –5040 Total, 11,567 Barrhead. December 17, 287 ... 23, 346 Increase, 59 – Paisley Advertiser.</p>
         <p>The Paisley Manufacturing Committee. –This Committee continue to carry on their operations with energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000, and is still on the increase.
            They have given out about 700 webs already, and are as busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs warped in Paisley, they have sent for assistance in this respect
            both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given to warpers, winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour Street, in order
            that they may the more easily supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the implement fund should be somewhat enlarged, as the other funds of the Committee are not
            trenched on for that purpose – Ibid.</p>
         <p>Ducal Generosity.–After the late county meeting at Hamilton, at which addresses were voted to the Queen and Prince Albert, his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who had
            attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was the widow of a respectable wood merchant, now
            deceased, and had been confined for upwards of a year, at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh, for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His Grace immediately caused the
            truth of the poor woman's story to be investigated, and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to be paid by his factor, and procured the woman's liberation, who has thus
            through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the superintendence of her young family.– Reformers' Gazette.</p>
         <p>Presentation. –A number of the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, met in their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown, in name of the
            congregation, presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin, A.M., their pastor, with a handsome pulpit gown and cassock, as a mark of their respect and esteem; after which a number of the influential
            members of the congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn– Mr Daniel Gray, collector, Coltness Railway, in the chair, and Dr Clarkson, croupier–when
            the evening was spent in the most friendly, happy, and intellectual manner.</p>
         <p>A Rescue.–Last week, while the Duke of Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell, he heard the screams of a female, and on looking towards the place whence the
            cries came, he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this, than he rode up to the scene of cruelty, dismounted from his horse,
            knocked the savage down, rescued the woman, and sent her home rejoicing, with more money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a long time. When we recollect that his
            Grace was born so long ago as October 1767, and so is in his 75th year, we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry, humanity, and intrepidity– Glasgow Chronicle.Town Council. –The usual
            meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the Christmas holidays.</p>
         <p>House of Industry. –We understand that Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling.</p>
         <p>Old Church.–The Lords of her Majesty's Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council, for
            altering the Assembly Aisle, and rendering it fit to be permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the city congregations.</p>
         <p>Prince of Wales Fund. –In the table of sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police, published in our paper of Saturday last, that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120, 12s. 9d. Mr
            Lindores, the General Commissioner, requests us to state, that the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275, 12s. 9d., and that the difference between the two sums is the amount of the very
            handsome subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square, and which were drawn by the Treasurer.</p>
         <p>Presentation of Plate. –On Friday afternoon, about fifty citizens entertained Mr William Donaldson, of the Albion Cloth Company, to an elegant dinner and dessert, in the Turf Hotel,
            Princes Street, for the purpose of presenting him with a testimonial of their esteem, subscribed for by the members of the Celtic Lodge, and other private friends. Mr William Wright, hat
            manufacturer, was in the chair, supported on the right and left by the guest of the evening, Mr Pritchard of the Theatre-Royal, and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as
            croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given, the chairman called for a bona fide bumper for the toast of the evening, and, after passing a handomse eulogium on
            those various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to all his friends, neighbours, and acquaintances, far and wide, presented to Mr Donaldson, in the name of the subscribers, a
            very elegant and massive silver tea set, of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in
            modest and appropriate terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts
            were suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music, from amateurs, was never wanting; the guest
            himself being a host in that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the various pieces of playe :–"To Mr William Donaldson, R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and
            Leith, from a number of Masonic and other Friends.–24th Dec. 1841."</p>
         <p>Theft and Recovery of a Pony. –At a late hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the town dismounted from his pony at his own gate, and proceeding inwards,
            leaving the animal to follow, as he was wont to do, to the stable. On looking about, he observed a young man, whom he supposed to be his son, take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly
            afterwards the son came into the house, and the question of "Where is the pony?" soon convinced the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search, and while the
            gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office, his son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the
            latter very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side, ran down the Fleshmarket stairs, and escaped.</p>
         <p>Providential Recovery. –One day last week, a fine little child, about five years of age, belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho, having dandered[?] away with another little
            play-fellow, like himself, to a little distance from the house, fell into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The apparently dead body of the little one
            being got out, was taken home, and all hopes of its recovery given up, when Dr Pringle, and excellent young gentleman, who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at Ratho, made his appearance,
            and, by applying himself with indefatiguable perseverance, succeeded in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as ever.</p>
         <p>Mungo Park. –A public meeting was held in the town hall of Selkirk, on Monday the 26th current, the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the view of
            erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the memory of this celebrated traveller.</p>
         <p>Thimble-Riggers. –A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number and one of them, an
            old man of rather respectable appearance, is generally in advance of the party, and having got into conversation with a passenger on the road, and the others running up, and desiring the
            old man to try his luck; he does so, and winning a trifle, he easily persuades the person with whom he has been ingratiating himself to try also, and he is soon robbed of his whole spare
            cash. Information having, on Wednesday last, been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws, and the gang were on the new Kilmarnock Road, he immediately despatched two rural police
            officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the gang, they separated and ran off, but the officers captured two of them (the old man and another), who were safely lodged in
            Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought before two of the Justices, and several person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their money, they were sentenced tothirty days'
            imprisonment in Paisley House of Correction, with hard labour, as rogues and vagabonds; and an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder of the gang.</p>
         <p>Stoppage of Payments by the Town of Paisley. –Partly on account of the great depression of trade, and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements
            regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley, theTown Council, at a meeting on Wednesday evening, ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits, in the meantime,
            but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed, and other current
            engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal
            authority, have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power, by attacking the credit of the community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the
            Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property, for entries, &amp;c. falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of revenue.
            This simple circumstance was taken advantage of, though nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be
            found by the individuals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the same party in the Council during the last five days gave currency to
            another statement which they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was he had not drawn out a
            penny. From the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been
            negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied, which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained, though at present that
            is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors, from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the town are due to the Bank and the
            members of Council, or their immediate friends, and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced
            of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs.– Glasgow Chronicle.</p>
         <p>Disgraceful Trick.–At a late wake in the country, a short way from Crieff, a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and women present
            were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the cord, when corpse started up in the bed, making the clothes to fly off; the whole party rushed to the door, crying for mercy upon
            them, and knocking each other over in the hurry, when at length some people came to their assistance, who afterwards discovered the cause of their terror.– Perth Courier.</p>
         <p>The Church Question. –Long ago, Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement, by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his friends, provided the
            independent power of the Church were secured. Now, this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence. It confers no privilege
            on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy. It is, in fact, the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be
            to sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand, and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled power to the Church The General Steam Navigation Company's ship
            Monarch, Captain Fraser, arrived at Granton from London on Monday evening at half-past nine o'clock.</p>
         <p>Election of a Minister for Old Monk- land. –The election of a minster took place at Old Monkland Church, on Thursday the 23d inst., and the right of patronage being vested in the Heritors
            and Kirk-Session, the election might be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the meeting, and a decided wish having been expressed by, it is understood, the whole of the
            heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen, the meeting, acting upon this principle, unanimously agreed to elect the Rev.
            Mr Johnston, Greenock, as minister of the parish. Considering the number of voters, the unanimity that prevailed among the electors, it is believed, is without precedent and stongly marks
            the sentiments and feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall,
            seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie, and unanimously elected.– Reformers' Gazette.</p>
         <p>Destructive Fire. –About three o'clock on the morning of the 25th curt., an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan Mill, in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr Kissock,
            and despite the great exertions of himself, servants and neighbours, the work of destruction proceeded with a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The
            flames in their fury having charred the rafters, the roof fell in with a loud crash; and, before long, the entire mill, with the exception of the side walls, became an unbroken mass of
            ruins. The building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal, the property of the tacksman, all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a
            very few hours previously, suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen, but no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire, if wilful, implies the
            blackest malice, and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands are in want of, and would gladly toil for, if they only knew how–daily bread–

         <p>Hamilton. –Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the requisite arrangements
            have been made for carrying the views of the subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now friendly to
            the scheme, never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy, till they have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers, by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices
            by law, and yet set that very law at defiance, in virtue of which they hold offices, and draw their "temporalities," as they cantingly term their good things, which alone induce some of
            them, at least, to remain members of the venerable Establishment. Who would have believed, some years ago, that "Black Prelacy" was about to be established within sight of Bothwell

         <p>Another New Field for Emi gration</p>
         <p>The Falkland Islands have been nominally a British colony for some years; but, in consequence of representations made to Government by various persons interested in the trade to the South
            Seas, a plan has at least been drawn up for establishing a body of settlers in these islands. It was submitted to the late Ministers, who referred it to the Commissioners of Emigration and
            the Lords of the Admiralty, by both of whom it was approved. Rules were prepared by the Commissioners of Emigration ; a vote of t3750 was put into the estimates for the first year's
            expense, and, we suppose, passed. If steps have not been taken already to send out emigrants, we presume they will be taken about the beginning of next winter, which is their summer.</p>
         <p>These islands are about 300 miles from the south extremity of the American continent, in a latitude corresponding with that of London. Their climate, however, very closely resembles that
            of Shetland. They have cold summers and mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but owing to their humidity and want of sunshine, and the stormy winds which blow almost constantly, wheat
            of barley could not be raised in them, and even oats might turn out to be a precarious crop. It is doubted also if wood will grow, and at present there is not a single tree in the islands.
            Turnips and potatoes succeed well, and there is an abundance of good grass, upon which some thousands of black cattle, horses, and hogs, thrive in the wild state, and sheep have been
            introduced and found to do well. Extensive peatbogs exist, which will afford a sufficient supply of fuel. The present population consists of twentyfive persons, young and old–one-half of
            them British, the other Gauchos, South American Indians of a semi-civilised description. They are all stationed at Port-Louis, a fine natural harbour, where a British officer resides.</p>
         <p>The islands are numerous, but all very small except two, whose area is estimated at 13,000 square miles, or nearly half the extent of Scotland. They are deeply perforated by arms of the
            sea, and probably afford a greater number of fine natural harbours than any country of equal extent in the world. Their shores afford excellent fish of many kinds, and seals are
            exceedingly numerous.</p>
         <p>The great object in establishing a colony here is to provide a harbour of refuge and place of refitment for our ships frequenting the South Seas, which are yearly increasing in number.
            Every vessel going to the Pacific Ocean, or coming from it, passes within sight of these islands, or near them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass these islands annually coming from
            Chili or Peru, and 20 more engaged in the whale fishery. The trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels, most of which return to England by this route, which will also be preferred by
            vessels trading to New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Port Philip, and probably South Australia. From Sydney or Hort Town the distance is nearly the same by Cape Horn or the Cape of Good
            Hope, but the prevalence of westerly winds in the parallel beyond the 30th, renders the latter route the more advantageous on the outward voyage, and the former on the return. The Falkland
            Islands are about half as distant from Britain as New South Wales.</p>
         <p>The Emigration Board recommend that Government should send out two surveyors to select an eligible site for a town, and to lay out the land in blocks of half a square mile, which may be
            subdivided. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at 12s. per acre, and to expend part of the money in carrying out additional settlers, part in defraying the colonial outlay. There
            are 40,000 wild cattle in the largest island, the privilege of shooting which, or catching and taming them, might be sold to the settlers or a company. The climate is uninviting, but there
            is little doubt that persons accustomed to grazing or sheep farming, or to sealhunting, or deep-sea fishery, might drive a profitable trade here. A vast number of ships, making long
            voyages, American, French, Dutch, as well as British, pass the islands, and to these it would be a great accommodation to find supplies of provisions and the means of refitting here. Some
            of our starving population in the North of Scotland or the Islands, might better their circumstances by removing to the Falkland Islands.</p>

         <p>New Zealand.</p>
         <p>( From the Morning Chronicle..</p>
         <p>The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zealand Company to Lord John Russell will serve to remove all apprehensions, if any are yet entertained, with regard to the relations between that
            colony and the Government of the parent state. Many of the first names in the country honoured this splendid banquet by their presence ; and men of all parties, Tories, Whigs, and
            Radicals, appeared to be actuated only by one common feeling.</p>
         <p>The public are now tolerably familiar with the natural advantages of New Zealand, which appears destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton,
            with must felicity, observed, " that the position of the New Zealand islands on the map, their climate, fertility, abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most suited to the whale
            fisheries, and, above all, the character to the native population, led him to anticipate that these islands were likely to become the great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John
            Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for adding these important islands to the great colonial empire of this country.</p>
         <p>The speech of Lord John Russell was much and deservedly applauded.</p>
         <p>"I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation of this colony of New Zealand will tend to the honour and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to the prosperity and future greatness of
            the nation (cheers). It was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent my humble efforts in support of those exertions that had been made, and were about to be made, by the New
            Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I should be unworthy of your approbation if I took any extraordinary merit to myself ; for, in the first place, the principle of colonization, the
            value of colonies to this country, the means they afford of augmenting her strength, of adding to her power, of promoting her wealth, and of increasing her prosperity– all this has been
            ascertained and demonstrated by the enlightened discussions of past years (hear, hear). With regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we have had the advantage and assistance of
            the most enlightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion I, therefore, can only take to myself the merit of not being blind to the importance and value of those opinions and
            discussions (hear, and cheers)"</p>
         <p>But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his own merits, in recommending the adoption of these islands by the Crown, it was perfectly well understood by all present that, for his
            conduct with respect to his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the gratitude of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the sagacity
            with which he had appreciated the importance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on the administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious measure of setting up the British
            flag in them.</p>
         <p>We may observe that the health of her Majesty's Ministers, proposed by Mr Hutt, M.P., was received with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr Labouchere's speech, which was a very good
            one, was well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to the City on this occasion is calculated to gain the Government favour among the commercial classes. His lordship may well be
            proud, that though New Zealand was formally taken possession of in the name of the Sovereign of this country many years ago, it was reserved for him to make it a British colony.</p>

         <p>There is something curious in the preference which the emigrants from England, Scotland, and Ireland display for different localities. The proportions emigrating the countries below are as
            follows:–</p>
         <p>Emigrants English Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. To United States, 54, 14 1/2, 12 – Sydney, 17, 21 1/2, 7 – Canada, 8 1/2, 25, 50 – Port-Philip, 8, 14, 7</p>
         <p>As the table expressly bears to be " a return of the persons who have emigrated," we can scarcely suppose that it includes persons who went out to the countries mentioned on business,
            without any intention of settling. In the report for Canada, the number who went to the United States in 1841, is stated to be only 32,500, or about two thirds of what stands in the above
            table.</p>
         <p>It will be observed, that not a single emigrant to India or Ceylon appears in the table; yet surely some persons go with the express view of remaining in these countries.</p>
         <p>The number of person who were enabled to emigrate in 1841 by means of bounties payable in the colonies, was, for New South Wales 22,752, for Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remembered
            that New South Wales includes PortPhilip.</p>
         <p>There are returns of land sold, but not in a very perfect form. In Canada, in the year 1839, 1840, and 1841, the lands sold were 176,518 acres. The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in
            Lower, and 12s. to 13s. in Upper Canada; the lands granted without sale were 194,000 acres, exclusive of those for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Cape Breton,
            about 200,000 acres have been sold at prices varying from 2s. 3d. to 3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable.</p>
         <p>At the Cape, 129,000 acres have been sold in the three years, at prices from 2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d.</p>
         <p>Lands sold in New South Wales Acres. Average Price. Sydney District–1839, 234,272, 8s 2 1/2d. 1840, 105,900, 18s. 8 1/2d. 1841, 15,790, 20s. 0 1/2d. Port-Philip–1839, 38,343 36s. 6 1/2d.
            1840, 83,687, 51s. 11 3/4d. (Six months)–, 53,733, 20s. 0d. 531,930</p>
         <p>The sales were chiefly by auction.</p>
         <p>In Van Diemen's Land, the sales in 1839, 1840, were about 130,000 acres, at 10s. or 11s.; in Western Australia (Swan River), in 1839, 1840, 1841, the sales were 71,000 acres, from 6s. 1d.
            to 11s.; in South Australia, 55,000 acres, at 20s. The sales of land are no bad index of the progress of the colonies in capital and cultivation; and, according to this criterion, it will
            be seen, that those which were advancing most rapidly in the three years, were Sydney and Port-Philip. The money received in payment of land in these two colonies in 1839 and 1840,
            amounted to t307,647; and, if we understand the report correctly, the whole of this sum is applicable to emigration, that is, to defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants.</p>
         <p>The 118,592 emigrants probably carried with them, or expended on their passage, twenty pounds each; and thus the money which left the country must have amounted to upwards of two
            millions.</p>
         <p>This gigantic emigration one of the things which convey an idea of the immense resources of Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the ninth part of the population of Europe; and we
            believe it may be safely said, that all the other eight parts do not send out half the number of emigrants annually which are sent by the British Isles alone.</p>

         <p>Australian Trust Company, Incorporated by Royal Charter, No. 48 Moorgate Street, London.</p>
         <p>Capital t1,000,00, in 10,000 shares of t100 each, with power to increase the capital to t2,000,000.</p>
         <p>Directors. Chairman– John Abel Smith, Esq., M.P. Levi Ames, Esq. . Robert How, Esq. Henry Bainbridge, . Esq. John Innes, Esq. Thomas Byron, jun., Esq. . Francis Mowatt, Esq. Benjamin

            Mayor. . Nassau William Senior, Abel Lewis Gower, Esq. . Esq. Bankers–Messrs Smith, Payne, &amp; Smiths. Solicitors–Messrs James, Charles, &amp; H. Freshfield. Colonial Board in Sydney.
            Chairman– Hastings Elwin, Esq. who was Deputy Chairman of the Court of Directors. Alexander Macleay, Esq. . Richard Jones, Esq. Thomas Barker, Esq. . John Lamb, Esq. To be joined by Thomas
            Icely, Esq. who was a Director here, and who is on his way to Sydney. Solicitor–James Norton, Esq.</p>
         <p>The Company was established and incorporated (and is now in full operation) to carry out in Australia a principle which has been acted on with great success elsewhere, namely, that of
            taking up money in this country, at a moderate rate of interest, on the credit of a large invested capital, and laying it out on undoubted freehold security, at a higher rate.</p>
         <p>The Company is now prepared to grant transferable notes, under the Corporation seal, to persons desirous of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The notes will be for t100 each, or any
            larger sum desired by the lender, and will be made payable at any period which may be agreed upon, not being shorter than two years. The notes will bear interest at the rate of five per
            cent, per annum, payable half-yearly (on the 15th January and 15th July), on the production of the half-yearly vouchers, which will be annexed to each note: these vouchers, or coupons,
            will render it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the note itself until the principal becomes due. The form of note has been preferred to that of bond, as admitting of
            transfer without expense or trouble, whilst it affords equal security to the holder.</p>
         <p>The Colonial Board has been established in Sydney, and the operation of the Company are at present confined to New South Wales.</p>
         <p>Security being the first object of the Company, all the arrangements have been framed with the view to attain that end.</p>
         <p>The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per cent, although the current rate is much higher. The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral security) must not be of less value than double
            the amount of the loan. The non-payment of interest on the day it becomes due, subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per cent, additional interest for the period in arrear; and all parties in
            default for ten days are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of the Company "without further instructions" and "without distinction or exception of any person whatever." The Colonial
            Board only draws on the Company, as loans are agreed on; their bills must be advertised for public competition and the purchasers pay the amount, in exchange for the Bill, to the Bank of
            Australasia (the Capital of which is t1,200,00) to the credit of the Company, to be drawn out by checks of the Colonial Board in favour of the borrowers as the mortgages are completed.</p>
         <p>The high character of the members of the Colonial Board, affords the fullest assurance that these arrangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as well as in form; no difficulty has
            been experienced in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by the instructions of the Court of Directors: indeed the Chairman of the Colonial Board states that "he does not entertain
            the smallest doubt of a safe investment of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal of the Colonial Board."</p>
         <p>The high rate of interest in Australia, has attracted much private capital from this country to be invested in mortgages. These investments have been made through the agency of individuals
            or mercantile firms, and therefore subject to contingencies from which the Company is exempt. To those who may desire to make such investments, it must be obvois that the stock of the
            Company presents a much superior security, and the prospect of a greatly increased return, inasmuch as the Company derives a large profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia, the money
            borrowed here at half that rate.</p>
         <p>It is equally clear that those who merely seek temporary employment for their money without becoming shareholders, cannot have a better security than the Promissory Notes of the Company,
            for the due payment of which, the whole capital of the Company, as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid out, stand pledged. Every shareholder is required to execute in a Deed
            of Covenant, by which he becomes bound to pay to the full amount of his shares, and the Charter supplies Creditors with the utmost facility in enforcing demands against the Company. When
            it is considered that the funds of the Company here are kept in Government Securities and no money lent in Australia, except on the best mortgages on land, with collateral security in
            addition, it may be fairly asserted, that in many respects the Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided preference over mortgages in this country, which generally bear one per cent. less
            interest than that paid by the Company.</p>
         <p>The Charter provides that the sums borrowed shall not exceed four times the amount of capital paid up.</p>
         <p>That the whole capital of the Company, and all the mortgages on which their money is lent, in Australia, shall constitute a security to the lenders of money to the Company.</p>
         <p>That the mortgages are to be on land, with the power of taking collateral security on stock, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>That every mortgage shall be registered–the register to contain such particulars as the Governor of the colony may deem necessary.</p>
         <p>That a copy of the register of the mortgages shall be kept at the office of the Company, in London, for the information of the share-holders and lenders.</p>
         <p>That an annual report be made to the Lords of the Treasury of all sums borrowed by the Company, and of the appropriation of them.</p>

            imminent danger of our life from the limbs of trees hanging just above the???; and through which we were often hurried??? rate of seven miles an hour, but the impetuo??? of the stream. If
            any of the canoes had been tangled among these branches (which in manyplaces hang very thick over the river), they??? inevitably have been overturned, and?????? buried in the ??? of the
            Ohio; fortunately??? accident happened to us.</p>
         <p>Our apprehensions of drowning were equalled by those of an attack from theIndians, who infest the river, and who inhabit??? banks: Some time ago they killed a Mr. W??? Browne, and a Mr.
            Allison, who were returning to Lexington from Miami. The barbarities they commit are wanton and inhuman to the l??? degree. On the 3d ult. they attacked a boat??? few miles from Limestone,
            and killed three???sons, two men and a woman; a few days after this they killed two men on Licking river, and took a boy prisoner, and on their return at???ed a boat below the Scioto, as
            it came to sh??? and killed four men, and took one man and two women prisoners. About three weeks ago they???ed on a boat and a canoe, above the Scioto,??? both sides of the river at the
            same time, bywhich means they killed two men; and in sho??? to such a degree have they carried these inh??? practices, that it is dangerous to stir fromhome, but in large parties, and
            properly prepar??? to receive them.</p>

         <p> Yesterday forenoon arrived at Spithead, the Lord Dorcester merchantman, Edward Howe, master, bound from Halifax for London.</p>
         <p>In this ship came six Cherokee Chiefs, of the first rank, one of them born in England.</p>
         <p>As soon as their arrival was announced in form, Sir Andrew Douglas, Commander of the Alcide, of 74 guns, sent his barge to bring them ashore to Portsmouth; and, upon landing, they went to
            Bradley's, the crown Inn.</p>
         <p>The object of these Chiefs coming to this country is, to endeavour to form a connection with the English Government, in order to attempt the reduction of Mexico, near which place they have
            20,000 men in arms, and can raise 30,000 more in a short time.</p>
         <p>The Cherokees have menaced that country for these last three years, and are favoured by great number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settlements; should they, therefore, procure
            respectable assistance from England, the New World will be a certain conquest, and open a source of trade and wealth to this nation, that will more than compensate for the loss of America,
            and the expence of attaining that grand object.</p>
         <p>These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of their country, with their faces painted in an extraordinary manner. They waited on Colonel Trigge, of the 12th regiment of foot, and some
            other officers of distinction. One of them, who was born in England, named Bowles, speaks English indifferently well, and is extremely communicative. He went over to America with his
            parents, who were in the army, when a boy, and by some means strayed to an Indian camp, where he was most hospitably received, and afterwards raised to the highest honours of their
            nation.</p>
         <p>The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this day, to deliver their??? to Mr. Secretary Grenville.</p>

         <p>MONDAY, J AN. 7. By the Fanny, Capt. Bryen, arrived in twenty four days from New York, we have American papers, of which we give the following important intelligence:–</p>
         <p>It is an undoubted truth, (Strange as it may appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet, Governor of Louisiana, and Governor O'Neal, of Pensacola, have opened the shores of the King of Spain, in
            West-Florida, to the Creeks and Cherokees, and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance, advising and stimulating them to go to war against the frontier inhabitants of the United
            States, and that quickly, that now or never was the time, while the United States were engaged with the northern tribes.</p>
         <p>On the 30th of September, about midnight John Buchanan's station, four miles south of Nashville,) at which sundry families had collected, and fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of
            Creeks and Lower Cherokees, supposed to consist of three of our hundred. Their approach was suspected by the running of cattle, that had taken fright at them, and upon examination, they
            were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate, and from the place and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them John M'Rocy. They immediately
            returned the fire, and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the station, blockhouses surrounded with a stockade for an hour, and were repulsed with considerable loss, without
            injuring man, woman, or child, in the station.</p>
         <p>During the whole time of the attack, the Indians were never more distant than ten yards from the Block House, and often in large numbers close round the lower walls, attempting to put fire
            to it. One ascended the roof with a torch, where he was shot, and falling to the ground, renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs, and was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through a
            port hole of the over???ing, which lodged in the roof in the circumference of the bat, and those sticking in the walls on the outside are innumerable.</p>
         <p>Undoubted advices have been received that as early at the 18th of September, as many as 500 Creeks passed the Tennessee, and the lower Cherokee towns, and below, as on their way they
            decared to make war on Cumberland–and that they were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those towns.–This must have been the party that attacked Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was
            expected, but it is now hoped, that the check they have received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon that settlement.</p>
         <p>On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the head of Crooked Creek, (a branch of Little River) at which there was a serjeant's command, of Cape, Crawford's company, was attacked, by
            surprise, about an hour and a half in the night, by a party of Indians, commanded by a Cherokee of Will's Town called the Tail, a brother of the Bench, and Talohteske, consisting of 3
            other Cherokees and 5 Creeks.</p>
         <p>James Paul was killed in the knife, and George Morse and Robert Sharp, at a fire on the outside and John Shankland wounded, 3 horses were killed, and 7 taken off.</p>
         <p>These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is due to Mr. Paton, their chief instrument, to add he has well acted his part!!!</p>
         <p>We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina), that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire broke out in that town, owing to the negligence of a small negro girl, which consumed about 40
            dwelling houses and stores, and 28 buildings of other descriptions.</p>

         <p>Richmond, January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec, to his Correspondent in this City, dated Jan. 9, 1972</p>
         <p>Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000, and that nothing saved General St. Clair,
            and the remainder of his army, but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes, and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder
            it, and to take scalps, the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation, acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of
            the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase, and the riches they obtained by the plunder, and the provisions they found, will make
            them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms, which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets,
            and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot, that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles
            back have all entered into an association, and made the present war a common concern, they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not
            less than 15 or 20,000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace, and offered his mediations; he told them
            he was at peace with the United States, and could give them no assistance. Their answer was, that the enemy was in their country, and would not make peace with them, but on term
            dishonourable, and at the expense of their country, and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received,
            and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood.</p>
         <p>You may depend on it, that many years will elapse, and many thousand men be expended before the United States will, by the present measures, be able to possess the country in contest; and
            I may also add, that I have great apprehensions, that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps
            might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the
            country from them by force, is founded in unrighteousness, and ought to be abandoned; besides, if the American mean to have anytrade with them, they are taking steps that will prevent it
            for many years to come. The Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuries</p>
         <p>Carlisle, Jan. 4. 1792.</p>
         <p>By the Pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday, we are informed, that previous to his leaving Pittsburgh, an express had arrived there with the melancholy news that Forts Jefferson and
            Franklin were taken by Indians, and that two large bodies of them were moving to the Allighany.</p>
         <p>Extract of a Letter from Patowmack, North Amerca, Feb. 7.</p>
         <p>"Last Sunday evening came to this town a young man from Cat-fish, which he left about two weeks ago, and who gave us the following pleasing interesting, and important intelligence, viz,
            that two days before he left Cat-fish, two men arrived there from Licking, who informed, that they had been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horseback from Kentucky, under General
            Scott; that they left Licking on the expedition a few days before Christmas; that General Scott dispatched three spies in advance, who, when they arrived about 13 miles beyond the spot
            where General St. Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the plunder they had taken, riding the bullocks, dancing, &amp;c. and
            appeared to be mostly drunk; that on the information being given to General Scott, who, with the main body, were a few miles in the rear, he divided them into three divisions, advanced,
            and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the contest was short, but victorious, on the side of the volunteers, 700 of the enemy being killed on the spot, all the cannon and stores in their
            possession retaken, and the remainder of that savage body put to flight; that General Scott, having lost but six men, returned to Licking in triumph, with most of the cattle, stores,
            &amp;c. leaving the cannon at Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previously gone out with 400 men, but finding his number was insufficient, was returning but met a body of 900
            volunteers when, upon joining him, he immediately proceeded in prosecution of his original design which fortunately proved successful.</p>
         <p>"Our informant further adds, that he saw a Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January, at Morgan Town, brought by Major Scott's expedition, which corresponded with that given by the two men
            at Cat Fish, and that Gen. Scott brought in near 700 scalps."</p>

         <p> The unsettled state of a great part of the Westtern Frontiers of America (if we can suppose that there are any determined frontiers when the settlers are making large and continual
            encroachments) must very much depreciate the sale of lands in those parts, notwithstanding the very small rates of purchase demanded for vast extents of ground, and the soil being
            remarkable fertile and productive. The ineffectual attempts of last summer to prevent the future depredations of the Miamis, and some other tribes of Indians, and the barbarities before
            and since committed on the setlers, must occasion other people to be very cautious of removing to places where they would hold their lives and property on a very precarious teure, unless
            the arms of the State prove remarkably successful in their future attacks.</p>

         <p>The red bugs, which did so much injury to the cotton last year, have again made their appearance, but not in such numbers as was first expected.</p>
         <p>The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive.</p>
         <p>A letter from Great-Ogreechee, in Georgia, dated December 9th, says, "since the completion of the treaty with the Creeks, all has been very quiet, unless we except some ill-natured state -
            bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves, chiefly occasioned by a few influential men, who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the Indians. These,
            however, we expect, will subside by degrees; notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the State. As to the Creeks, Siminoles, and other nations adjoining our Western
            frontier, nothing is clearer than that, so far from being injurious to us, they may henceforward be made useful to the real interests of this State, provided the faith of treaties be
            observed. They now show every disposition to copy our manners, arts, agriculture, and mode of living.</p>

         <p> Mr. Bowles, the Cherokee Chief, proposes to introduce the art of Printing amongst the Indians, with whom he resides; and, for this purpose, has engaged two persons to accompany him on his
            return, and has provided himself with all the implements of the art. The day fixed for their departure is the 20th of March</p>
         <p>The Indian companions of Mr. Bowles are two Creeks and two Cherokees. these nations, though contiguous to each other, and in strict union, differ as essentially as possible in language and
            manners. Both, however, entertain the most implacable animosity against the Spaniards, whose authority and dominions in South America they make no scruple of avowing they mean to try to
            diminish.</p>

         <p> The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six in number. They have been indiscriminately styled Cherokees, but three of them only are of that nation, and three are Creek Indians.–They
            are all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty - five or twenty-six. These six Chiefs have 20,000 warriors ready to take the field, and have the strongest wish to act in conjunction
            with the English. They travelled 3000 miles before the reached Halifax, and were near 12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord
            Dorchester, by whom they were sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the Ministry.</p>
         <p>The object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at. They long to make an attack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them was heard last night in the playhouse to say, he
            hoped in six months from this time to be in the heart of Mexico.</p>

         <p> When hostilities are once commenced, a forfidable armament will unquestionable be sent against the Spanish South American colonies. Of its success there cannot be a doubt, when we shall
            be aided by an army of 20,000 Indian warriors, beside the active support of those Mexicans now ??? under the tyranous yoke of Spain.</p>
         <p> So determined are the Cherokees, the Creeks, and other nations of Indians in the Southern parts of America, to strip the Spaniards of their possessions on that Continent, that they will
            unquestionably attempt the glorious achievement, even though the policy of this country should prevent us from lending them effectual assistance.</p>
         <p>The rich silver mines at Potosi, in Peru, were accidentally discovered in 1545, by an Indian, as he was clambering up the mountain, in pursuit of a Lama, which had strayed from his flock.
            Soon after, the mines, of Sacotecas, in New Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were opened. From that time successive discoveries have been made in both colonies, and silver
            mines are now so numerous that the working of them, and of some few mines of gold in the provinces of Terra Firm, and the new Kingdom of Grenada, has become the capital occupation of the
            Spaniards, and is reduced into the system no less complicated than interesting.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum to his Friend in the City of Norwich, (Connecticut,) dated Nov. 24, 1790.</p>
         <p>"The prospect of peace from our frontiers, seems to me to be vanished for the present; the troops from this garrison have this morning returned, and the best account I can collect of the
            expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amounting to about 1200 militia, and about 300 regulars, after seventeen days march from Miami, reached the great Miami village, about 170 miles,
            without any molestation, except having a number of their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they found the village deserted, and all the valuable builder a short tarry, they proceeded to
            neighings set on flames by the Indians. Afbouring villages, without molestation, and deftroyed five of them, and a quantity of corn, computed at fifteen thousand bushels, which they found
            buried in different places, and very large quantities of vegetables of every kind. The firstopposition that was met with, a party of about 150 Kentucky militia, and thirty regular troops,
            all under the command of Col. Hardin, of Kentucky, were detached from the main body, lying in the great Miami village, to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day before
            been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles, they came up with, and were attacked by surprise, by a body of Indians, who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large
            plain; and on the first onset the militia, without exchanging a single fire, made a most precipitate retreat, and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the Indians; the
            conflict was short and bloody; the troops were soon overpowered by numbers, and all fell, except the two offiers and two or three privates, after defending themselves at their bayonet
            points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn, of Franklin, was one of the four that escaped, and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling
            over a log in his retreat, and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers, that from any other circumstance. Captain Armstrong, who commanded the party, likewise made his
            escape, by plunging himself into a pond or swamp, up to his neck, within two hundred yards of the field of action, where he remained the whole night, as a spectator of the horrid scene of
            the War Dance, performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks, mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, rendered
            his situation shocking. After this, some few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing material, until the second capital action, which happened two days after the army left the Miami village. At
            ten miles distance from the town, the General ordered a halt, and detached from four to five hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, commanded by Major Wylls, all under the
            command of Col. Harden, with orders to march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town, there appeared a small body of Indians, who immediately fled at the first onset, and
            by that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by making their flight into different directions, and encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means the regular troops were left alone,
            and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia, they commenced the attack with their whole
            force, excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back, pursued their object of routing and
            destroying the troops; as the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody conflict on each side, they effect. The regular troops, all to nine, including two commissioned officers,
            were killed and disabled, and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, of Hartford, and Lieut. Frothingham, of Middletown. Of the militia, it is said, about an hundred were
            killed, among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, it appears, from some cause, did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action,
            for most of the troops that were not killed, or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they never could have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury.</p>
         <p>"Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the militia they appeared to despise, and with all the undautedness conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed upon
            the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them, for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman,
            two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages.</p>
         <p>"No damage, of any consequence, has been sustained in this part of the country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may have on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.–
            If the Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace, we shall be safe; if not, we are much exposed."</p>

         <p>New York, August 4.</p>
         <p>On Monday the 12th ult. there was a violent tempest at Leominster, Massachusetts, attended with hail which was of such a size, and fell with such velocity, that the stoutest Indian corn
            was beaten into shreds–vast quantities of apples were beaten from the trees–not only the fruit but the trees received great injury, the bark being broken from their limbs; the windows
            broken in the house, and the fences renewed such impressions, as to be discovered at 90 yards distance. Many of the hailstones were as large as hens eggs–the common size was a little more
            than an inch in diameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell, banks of it were measured at the foot of a hill, and found to be 20 inches deep.</p>
         <p>The Saturday following great damage was ??? by hail at Shrewsbury, country of Worcesster.</p>
         <p>August 15. On Sunday the 25th July, a violent hail storm commenced a few miles to the westward of Wilmington, Delaware, which did great damage to many fields of grain, and blew down, in
            many places, an immense quantity of timber. The hail in this storm was of an extraordinary appearance; part of it being about two inches long, and of a very considerable circumference.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, the 1st inst. arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, the brig Maria, Capt. fort, from Londonderry, with 200 passengers.</p>
         <p>On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia, the Happy Return, Capt. Ewing, in 8 weeks from Londonderry, brought 340 passengers in good health: Capt. Ewing parted, near the Capes of Delaware,
            with the ship Sally, Capt. Miller, with passengers from Londonderry for that port also.</p>
         <p>Pennsylvania, July 21. Last Sunday evening Mr. John Garrison, son of William Garrison, of Newbury township, in this county, was killed by lightning in his own house. The lightning struck
            in at the gable and just at the instant that Mr. Garrison was in the centre of the floor, walking towards the window; his brother was standing within two yards of him when he fell, but
            providentially received not the smallest hurt.</p>
         <p>We also learn, that Patrick M'Sherry, of Little's-town, in this county, had two cows killed by lightning, the same evening.</p>
         <p>New London, July 30. A slight shock of an earthquake was fel tin this and the neighhbouring towns, on Sunday morning last, about thirty minutes past five o'clock.</p>
         <p>Middletown, July 25. About five o'clock this morning, a noise was heard that seemed to pass over this city, which is thought to have come from a north-westerly direction and proceeded to a
            south-easterly one. The noise was equal to loud heavy thunder, and the commotion occasioned by it very sensible in the shaking of houses, but no damage was done.– The Tuesday preceding,
            about six or seven miles to the southward of this place, a similar but heavier noise was heard, attended with the like commotion.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Dartmouth, (Connecticut)July 26.</p>
         <p>"Some days ago a house near the college, was struck by lightning, and a child therein killed. Since that a woman was killed by the same means in Cornish, a town adjoining Dartmouth, as she
            sat in her house at work. Later still at Hampton, in New York state, a yoke of oxen were killed, both by one flash of lightning.–From what reason we cannot tell, but the lightning has been
            peculiarly destructive in many of our settlements during the present summer. It would aphowever, that nature is willing to repair those losses; accounts having just come to hand, that on
            last Monday morning a woman in FPlainfield was safely delivered of four girls at a???; one of whom died the night following, the rest likely to do well."</p>
         <p>Saturday, at a tavern near the market, the following specimen of gormandising was???ed :–A person, not for any bet, or without any other inducement, than the craving of the stomach,eat, at
            one meal, a shoulder of roast lamb, 3 slices of bacon, three quarters of a pound of cheese, 15 large cucumbers, one half of an 8d wheat loaf, a plate of cold potatoes, and drank a quarter
            of cider.</p>

         <p>CONGRESS. Wednesday, Dec. 8.</p>
         <p>The SPEECH of George Washington , Esq;President of the Congress, on??? the ???</p>
         <p>Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives,</p>
         <p>I N meeting you again, I feel much satisfaction on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits
            of another year have blessed our country with plenty, and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock
            abroad, as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes, have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter
            circumstance is the more pleasing, as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources, but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let
            me add, as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been
            exemplary.</p>
         <p>"In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session, a loan of 3,000,,000 of florins, towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place, has been
            completed in Holland.–As well theexchange with which it has been filled, as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing, created by the situation of
            Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers, may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such
            further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.</p>
         <p>"Since your last sessions, I have received communication, by which it appears, that the district of Kentucke, at present a part of Virginia, has concurred in certain propositions contained
            in a law of that state, in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application
            is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted, will be found to do great
            honour to both the parties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government, expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke, cannot fail to add an affectionate
            concern for their particular welfare, to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.</p>
         <p>"It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These,
            with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash, have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and, being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by
            such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities, or afford them a retreat for their prisoners, and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the
            humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus
            been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking, whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.</p>
         <p>"These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements, that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less
            capable of punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures, it became
            necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition, in which the
            regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me, The Secretary at War is directed to lay before
            you a statement of the information on which it is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.</p>
         <p>The disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed
            by the United States, reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a
            war, and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country, to abridge in means, and there by enhance the prince of transporting its
            valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections, how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these
            contingencies, by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the moments most interesting
            to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce, offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.</p>
         <p>"Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it
            destresful to us, that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.</p>
         <p>"The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system, have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom, whether
            improvement of a judicatory system, have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom, whether im provements in that system may yet be made,
            and particularly whether??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts, be not desirable through all the States.</p>
         <p>"The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and seamen, has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that
            jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them, either by express convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too, with his
            most Christian Majesty, has stipulated in certain cases, the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these
            stipulations into full effect.</p>
         <p>"The establishment of the Militia, of a Mint, of Standards of Weights and Measures, of the Post Office and Post Roads, are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course, and which
            are abundantly urged by their own importance.</p>
         <p>" Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, "The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the residuary
            provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope, that it will be a favourite policy with you, not merely to
            secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded, but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit, to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation
            you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject, and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute, along with other means, to the
            actual reduction of the public debt, the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest, as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.</p>
         <p>" Gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Representatives.</p>
         <p>"In perusing the various and weighty business of the present session, I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom, and animated by the love
            of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both, and our best reward,
            if by a successful administration of our respective trusts, we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens, and more and
            more the object of their attachment and confidence. (Signed) GEORGE WASHINGTON." United States, Dec. 8 1790.</p>

         <p> The following, it is said, are the authentic particulars of General St Clair's expedition in America. The Miamis Indians had been for a long time extremely troublesome to the Americans,
            and it was determined to drive them to the back country. General St. Clair completely accomplished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the Indians
            on the River St. Joseph, where a severe battle was fought. Many Indians were killed, but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, and 150 men were killed, and they were not able
            even to bring off their wounded. This success will in all probability give the Indians new courage, and induce them again to make head against the American army.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Boston, New England, Dec. 11.</p>
         <p>"The demands for the produce of America are most rapidly increasing: one single house has actuallyexported and sold, within a very short time, 2000 barrels of pot and pear ashes, 2000
            barrels of beef, 500 ditto of pork, 70,000lb. weight of butter, and 1500 bushels of bean and peas.</p>
         <p>"Our news from New York is very disagreeable indeed. Gen. Scott, Major Fountain, Major Willis, Capt. M'Murtry, and Lieut. Fortingham, have all fallen sacrifices to the Indians, after a
            terrible conflict on the banks of a river; there were such numbers of the Indians killed,and thrown into the river, that their dead bodies actually stopped the current of it.</p>
         <p>"The frost is very intense at New York"</p>
         <p>During the late gales of wind, the smugglers have been uncommonly active on all the coasts of the kingdom. The risk of their lives secured their property–for the Custon-house boats were
            afraid to follow them.</p>
         <p>From many parts of the country we have received accounts of the land being entirely flooded by the late heavy rains.</p>
         <p>A prisoner who was tried last week try town sessions, for stealing iron, being acquitted by the Jury, addressed them in the following words: "Gentlemen, I most sincerely thank you for your
            lenity, and promise never to be guilty of the like offence again."</p>

         <p>New-YorkOct. 11. We are informed that the census of Philadelphia is completed, and that the city is found to contain fifty three thousand inhabitants.</p>
         <p>A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that state, that a serious petition is now drawing up, to be presented to the next congress, stating arguments in
            favour of polygamy, from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a man may legally marry two wives. This, it is thought, will be the most effectual means to extirpate the numerous
            race of old maids, and increase the population of the United States. The petition is to be presented by a gentleman residing at Cabin Point.</p>
         <p>Oct 12. In one of the Charleston papers of the 16th ult. appears the epistle from the yearly meeting of the Quakers in London, to the friends in Great Britain, Ireland and America. It is
            remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper, the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted.</p>
         <p>Oct. 13. The ship Betsy, Rook, arrived on the 6th instant, at Wilmington, Delaware,, from Londonderry, in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants, some of them
            people of property; who, weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint, St. Patrick, have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America, under the more liberal auspices of
            St. Tammany.</p>
         <p>The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence, and has left a widow and five scorpions. I understand he died
            deetested and made me executioner, but as the estate is like to prove insolent, I was told that as you was Judge of reprobates, you must send me a letter of condemnation. And as in duty
            bound ??? ??? pray, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman, in the countyof Lincoln, Massachusets, dated Sept. 14.</p>
         <p>"We have had a very wet season here since you went from us, and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens, and all the grass; of course, as the natural
            consequences, we have no milk, neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insects"</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia)Sept. 20</p>
         <p>"A firm peace being now, to all appearance, secured between the United States and the Creek Indians, we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good
            effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value,
            and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, who instead of being mere lookers on, in quality of overseers and drivers,
            would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and
            the mouth of Altamahaw, is one of the most beautiful you can imagine,abounding with everything that can make life comfortable, besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end
            of Sapola, with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France, (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship
            timber and??? in the river of St. Mary's."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia)Sept. 25. "There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river, the exportations of which, in the
            opinion of rational men, ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals, and clays for the several colours of paint, which may be had in any
            quantity, and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, from every discovery we have been able to make, are inexhaustible; all the samples, however, that you have yet seen are
            mere pickings up on the surface, and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with
            funds sufficient to take this matter in hand, there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe, and at a
            much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints, there are none better in the world, and in quantity, when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the
            river, of property and enterprize, are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature, it is thought that these two articles are by no
            means objects beneath their attention."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Charleston, Sept. 27.</p>
         <p>"On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard, Hubcaw, a fine new brig, calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice, the property of Mr. Hary Grant, and is to be called the
            Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight, with which they were no less delighted, than with the liberal entertainment and polite attention of Mr.
            O???."</p>
         <p>Boston, Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port, the ship Columbia, Capt. Robert Gray, on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the
            Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen, owners of the ship, for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of???has returned
            to the place of its nativity.</p>
         <p>Dr. FRANKLINNever declare yourself the author of a???, without being, beyond doubt, certain of???, was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example.</p>
         <p>I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very
            warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and he well pleased with the success of his
            persuasion, went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it into small pieces, which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern
            keeper goes round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns, and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation, boasts of what he
            had been doing for him; "It was I persuaded them to make the collection, I made them give, I went round to every one, and see what I have got. If it had not been for me"–the fiddler
            examines his prize, and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders, who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success
            was fully ascertained.</p>

         <p> The Indians, on the borders of Kentucky, continue to commit the most horrible acts of cruelty upon such unfortunate Americans as fall in their power. The burning of the Miami villages,
            and the destruction of their corn and vegetables, instead of intimidating those ferocious savage, have made them more and more vindictive and restless; and being acquainted with all the
            passes in the country, they bid defiance to their pursuers, whom they frequently surprise and cut off.</p>

         <p>From the New York Journal. Winchester, Oct. 20.</p>
         <p>By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn that a short time ago an American vessel was seized at New Orleans, and her cargo disposed of by the Spaniards. Also, that the troop which
            went out against the Indians had, not far from the banks of the Ohio, fallen in with about forty of them, whom they made their prisoners, after a slight resistance; and that having washed
            them, 15 turned out to be white men.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, Nov 9.</p>
         <p>We hear from undoubted authority, that a considerable loan has been negotiated in Holland for the service of these United States.</p>
         <p>Albany, Nov. 4.</p>
         <p>The Legislature of Vermont have resolved to pay to the State of New York 30,000 dollars, agreeably to the first proposition contained in the declaration of the Commissioners of this State,
            appointed to declare the consent of the Legislature thereof, that a certain territory within the jurisdiction of the State of New York be erected into a new State on the 17th of October
            last; in consequnece whereof, all rights and titles to lands within the State of Vermont, under grants of the late colony of New York, or from the State of New York (except such grants as
            were intended as confirmations of those from New Hampshire) cease and determine. The Legislature have also resolved, that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the
            constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December, and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first
            Thursday in January, for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators, and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress.</p>
         <p>New York, Nov. 18.</p>
         <p>The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved, That so much of this act, entitled, "An Act, making provision for the
            provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt, is dangerous to the rights, and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked
            disapprobation of the General Assembly."</p>
         <p>Portland, Nov. 15.</p>
         <p>The stone work of the light house, at the entrance of our harbour, is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant, the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols, of this town, master builder. The
            work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high. To this the lanthorn, which is to be six feet in diameter, will add about 15 feet, 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is
            now preparing, and will probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month.</p>
         <p>Baltimore, Nov. 23.</p>
         <p>A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder, and the necessary mill-works will be speedily
            erected in the vicinity of this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly advantageous to this State and town, but may, if properly encouraged, become a national
            benefit.</p>
         <p>York (Pennsylvania), Nov 10. From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, as a boat was coming from the East side, a most tremendous storm arose when she
            was about half way over, by which means she was soon filled with water, and sunk. there was six passengers and the??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses, viz. a
            clergyman, the owner of the waggon, with his wife and three children; when the storm came on, the woman and children took shelter in the waggon, but it continued to blow with such violence
            that the waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage, and being pretty tight, floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock;
            the husband, viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish with them, and quitting the boat swam to the waggon, cut open the cover with his
            knife, and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he
            found the boat sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other
            boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar, but it is thought he is drowned, as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls,
            and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost, was found next day some distance below the falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear to have received the least
            injury.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Sunbury, NorthumberlandCounty (Pennsylvania), dated Nov. 13.</p>
         <p>"One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek, was tried on Saturday evening, and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, and
            the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict
            in his favour, and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit, that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea, which the Attorney General, with all his
            endeavours, could not beat out of them, that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can
            pacify the Indians now, Heaven knows, while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country, and no one will arrest them."</p>

         <p>Halifax, April 6.</p>
         <p>The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down, and the Mill there is much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly
            carried away; and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will repair.</p>
         <p>Since the retreat of the f–eral troops, under General Harmar, the Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties. A large body of them, on the 2d of February, attacked the settlements
            called Big Bottom, twenty miles from Harman, on the Muilsingam, which they entirely destroyed. Eleven men and two children were massacred, two escaped and three were taken prisoners.</p>
         <p>Boston.</p>
         <p>The amount of the value of theexports from the United States, for thirteen months, agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury, in 20,000,000 dollars.</p>
         <p>The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state, that there has been a confederation of all the South West Indians
            to fall on our frontiers early in the spring.</p>
         <p>Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country of Marcetta, from their plantations into the city, where they do military duty.</p>
         <p>According to the late Census, the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470,000.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, April 7. Congress met here to-day and made a house, Articles of the Constitution, that were not liked by many of us, are altered much for the better– among other things, we
            were dissatisfied that not any notice was taken of Religion, as we wanted it expressly declared, that not any sect should ever be established in preference to another.–This is now done. In
            this part of the world we know not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free.</p>
         <p>It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of people; we are yet about three, so that,for sometime we have have not any great cause to fight for territory.</p>

         <p> The brig Virginia Planter, James Merrifield, Master, arrived at Liverpool, brings information that on the 5th of May, General Wayne, with two thousand provincials, had attacked totally
            destroyed most of the Indian towns at the back of Georgia, for near two hundred miles around the river. That M'Gilvray, and his army of savages, after an unsuccessful and bloody
            engagement, had fled to the woods, where the General left them, and returned to Savannah.– This expedition was undertaken about the beginning of March, winch has been crowned with the
            expected catastrophe, and though the Cherokee, Miami, and Chiquesaw tribes, may mediate revenge at some future period; it is not likely they will be in a condition to disturb the settlers
            for some years to come.</p>

         <p>From the Jamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston, Nov. 28.</p>
         <p>By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn, that the people are in quietness, but still armed; and that the Governor, who had been suffered to remain, but the Intendent only having fled, is
            perfectly submissive to the will of the people.</p>
         <p>For several days last week the weather at the north side, and in some of the Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts, and the cold is said to have been peculiarly sever; some
            plantain trees have been thrown down, but we have yet heard of no material damage.</p>
         <p>The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th regiment of foot, consisting of a serjeant, and 29 privates, having received them from on board the ship Commerce,
            Foot, from London, off the East End on Thursday last, the Commerce being destined for Savanna la Mar.</p>
         <p>Dec. 26. Late on Thursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion, Captain Nichols, returned to Port-Royal from the Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena, but was
            prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port. Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken place amongst the Indians in that quarter, and that the
            Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country, which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so apprehensive are they of the numbers and force of the
            malcontents, should they possess themselves of any of those strong holds.</p>
         <p>We learn from Georgia, that the treaty with the Indians, to negotiate with Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States, has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray
            and his warriors have declared, that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding, that no equivalent can be given to the
            Georgians for relinquishing their claim to the district in question, as it is founded in usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident, as it is known
            that he wishes to establish a sea-port at St Mary's, as well for thecommercial emolument, as for the civilization of his countrymen, by an intercourse with foreign States.</p>

         <p> The laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and that of Massachusetts, by which the punishment of death is abolished, in all cases except for wilful murder, are about to be adopted by the
            respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria, has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England.</p>
         <p>The abolition of Negro slavery, which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire, Massachusets, Rhode island, Connecticut, and Vermont; in the Midland States of New
            York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky, for several years past is now extended, by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia, North
            Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November, 1795.</p>
         <p>The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State, in proportion to the numbers of the respective families, where
            the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified, by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms, and form communities of civilized Societies.</p>
         <p>Before the Gentleman, who has favoured us with this Intelligence, left America, they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day, parade
            to Church in all the magnificence of the Order, where a sermon was preached, on the occasion, by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools, employed??? and erected
            places of Public Worship.</p>
         <p>The Officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Soldiers, who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country, have at last received a reward, infinitely beyond
            their expectations, but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic.</p>
         <p>Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress, this last Session, to each individual, who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the
            Rights of Nature, and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value, to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran, as
            has been the case of former grants, he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money, at the present market price, from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land, and
            the rest in money,a s may be most agreeable to the receiver.</p>
         <p>The Mint of the United States, which was established two years since, has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles, half
            eagles, and quarter eagles.</p>
         <p>The first is exactly five and forty shillings, English money, or ten American coin.</p>
         <p>The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half, and quater, which makes the courie of exchange simple, and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive, that
            ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle.</p>
         <p>There is, besides, one more silver coin, which is called a Dime, and is the tenth part of a dollar.</p>
         <p>The copper coin is called a Cent, and is the tenth part of a Dime.</p>
         <p>Six of the ships of war, which were voted by Congress in November last, are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next, and will complete a
            fleet of???hundred guns.</p>
         <p>The city of Washington, which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States, will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a
            beautiful eminence, and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising
            ground near the banks of the Potamac, possessing a delightful water prospect, together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city.</p>
         <p>From the President's house to the Capitol, run two great pleasure parks or malls, which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac, and are ornamented at the sides by elegant
            buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol, as well as those of the President's house, are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much
            retarded by the want of stone cutters, masons, bricklayers, carpenters, and blacksmiths, who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per
            day.</p>
         <p>The district of Country at the back of North Carolina, reaching to the Mississippi, and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad, is next winter to be formed into a
            Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine, extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix, is expected to form a Seventeenth.</p>
         <p>The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville, in the State of Georgia; Martenberg, the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia, the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville
            and Nashville, in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville, Fairfield, and Lexington, in the State of Kentucky; Washington, the Capital of the United States; Sunbury, in the State of
            Pennsylvania; Hudson, upon Husdon's River, and Cooper's Town, in the State of New York; Bennington, in the State of Vermont; and Paterson, in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt
            by the English in the was, have been rebuilt, and the old cities of Charlestown, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, have been extended to more than double the extent they had
            before the peace.</p>
         <p>The population of the United States, by the last Census in 1790, was more than double what it was in 1775, by which it appears, that America doubles her number of people every fifteen
            years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country, are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great
            as to people four new States, and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South, and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.</p>

         <p>Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated the 9th May last, mention, that General Wayne had been dispatched, in the beginning of March, on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis and
            Chickesau Indians, who have, for some time past, had as their chief warrior, one Macgillivray, a Scotchman, who has long resided among these Indians. General Wayne, at the head of two
            thousand Provincials, had completely routed them after a great slaughter. After the battle, Macgillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most part
            of the habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river, which is the boundary of Georgia, after which he returned to Savannah. This defeat is so total, that
            it will put it out of the power of these Indians to be again troublesome to the State of Virginia.</p>

         <p>The American States having now gained their independence, have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known, that the
            Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, to enable them to distress the Americans, and prove at
            least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards, now in possession of the Floridas, have been continually
            quarrelling with them about their boundaries.</p>
         <p>It may therefore be considered as almost certain, that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for
            though American cannot furnish money, she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands.
            Their privateers, too, will be able to take their runs so speedily, that the Spanish trade must be very materially injured thereby.</p>

         <p>Kingston, Feb. 6.</p>
         <p>By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn, that the small-pox raged lately at &gt;Surinam, to such a degree that, within the space of two months, upwards of 2500 persons had
            perished by that disorder.</p>
         <p>A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the evening of last Thursday se'ennight, at the settlements near the Blue Mountains.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday the 3d instant, arrived at Lucca, the ship Pitt, Captain Hunter, from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom Captain
            Hunter has brought confined in irons, and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions.</p>
         <p>Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray, and the nations under his immediate controul, or in alliance with him, are subsidied by
            the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, arms and ammunition, from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and therefore in
            all probability; the sword not the olive branch, will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes.</p>
         <p>March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship Chichester, of 44 guns, armed en flute, Lieutenant Craven, Commander, having on board the first
            battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains, Duncan, Franer, Pemberton, and Mannoch; Lieutenants, Sir W.
            Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Puxley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J. Cockburne, Bart. Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. Young; Ma?e, Mr.
            Bolton.</p>
         <p>The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men, exch??e of 100 women and children.</p>
         <p>Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the room of Colonel Despard, recalled.</p>
         <p>Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay
            of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy determination.</p>
         <p>At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estate,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds!</p>
         <p>At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time
            taking possession of their quarters.</p>
         <p>Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and upwards, having possessed themselves of
            several field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the
            reason of so extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents demanded, that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies, should be presented imimmediately to the general, and that
            an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired, proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour
            had on what they termed the justice of the whites, with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation, and of qualifying
            for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect.</p>
         <p>On the perusal of this paper, it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia, who headed by the General, immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents
            fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded.</p>
         <p>A proclamation was then issued, offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender, and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On
            Sunday the 7th instant, a very great majority of those who had formed the camp, finding all their attempts completely frustrated, came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One
            or two of the principals, for whom high rewards are offered, are not yet taken.</p>
         <p>From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors,
            and she now lies stranded on the beach.</p>

         <p>NOOTKA SOUND.</p>
         <p>The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment, we are particularly happy in being enabled to
            give some further account of the transactions, that have happened at Nootka Sounds, as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of
            this trade.</p>
         <p>It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur, though beautiful and magnificent, is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of
            the Southern Provinces.</p>
         <p>Pekin is, therefore, the proper mart for this valuable commodity, and in this immense city, the consumption is so great, that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale.</p>
         <p>The Mandarins of the Court, and even the Emperor himself, are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank, a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury.</p>
         <p>The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds, that all the blankets, cloths, hats, and stockings, that could be procured in China, if
            English manufacture, were sold to the Indians, with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed.</p>
         <p>An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded.</p>
         <p>The Spaniards discovering that Callicum, a Chief, second in authority at Nootka Sound, was in alliance with the English, he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife
            of Callicum, with an infant child, escaped, but not till wounded.</p>
         <p>Macquilla, the Chief, first in command, retired at the head of the allies of England, from Nootka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards, they fled to distant parts. Such of the
            natives as they could seize, the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications.</p>
         <p>At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands, with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add, on authority that
            amounts nearly to demonstration, that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears, the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines.</p>
         <p>Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka, and other ports belonging to the Russians, with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an
            invaluable channel of commerce, as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians, who </p>
         <p>On this voyage of discovery and experiment, one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo, but was unfortunately lost on her return to China.</p>
         <p>To these curious particulars we add, with a patriot joy, that the consumption of the glorious staple of England, her broad cloths, is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British
            hardware, &amp;c. is also in great request.</p>
         <p>From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears, ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high, of
            proportionate bulk.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Philadelphia, July 22.</p>
         <p>"Trade is brisk at present, from the high prices and great sales of grain to Europe. Our farmers and giving above 6 s. currency (about 3s. sterling) to workmen per day and their meat, to
            enable them to take in new grounds, which is a great discouragement to our rising manufactories, which are obliged to give high wages to their journeymen on that account.</p>
         <p>"A Mr. Doylden from Europe has lately purchased two millions of acres of lands from Congress, Mr. Scriba, merchant in New York, has purchased four millions of acres, all from Congress, a
            society of gentlemen, with whom, it is said, some Dutch houses in Amsterdam are concerned, have purchased from the State of Georgia about fifteen millions of land on the frontiers of that
            State. The very highest price paid for any of these purchases has been twenty cents per acre, (about ten-pence British money) payable by installments at different periods, and that in
            Congress money."</p>

         <p>Richmond, Virginia, Dec. 1, 1790.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Kentucky, to a Member of the General Assembly, dated, Nov. 7, 1790.</p>
         <p>"I have been waiting with much impatience to obtain some certain account of our troops; many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon,
            contains an extract of a letter from Governor St. Clair to General Wilkinson, which mentions that our army had met with but little opposition. The Miami villages were abandoned, from
            thence a detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river, which fell in with a party of Indians, and had a severe engagement.</p>
         <p>"General Harmar made a shew of retreating, and marched about eight miles, when he detached a strong party to the field of action, in hopes of finding the Indians on the ground; as they
            expected, so they found them, and an action immediately commenced, which was obstinate on both sides.</p>
         <p>"A vast number of Indians were killed in crossing the St. Joseph's river. Major Fountain, of Fayette, and General Scott's son were killed the second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militiamen
            were killed; Major Willis, Lieut. Fotheringham, of the F–deral troops, and 77 privates, also fell in the action.</p>
         <p>"General Harmar did not send a single man to reinforce the detachment, consisting of 400 men, (who had to sustain the fire of the whole Indian army) although he had with him in camp
            upwards of 1100 men. Our men at last lost ground, Colonel Harding's wing was beaten, and finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall, of Bourbon, and Majors M'Million and Willis broke the other
            wing of the Indians, which occasioned the amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph.</p>
         <p>"General Harmar never sent to bring off the wounded, nor bury the dead. Captain David Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The Bourbon militia has suffered very much, nearly one
            third of them having fallen on the spot.</p>
         <p>"The army is now at Licking, and is expected home hourly.</p>
         <p>"This is the best account that I have been able to collect; it will be delivered to you by Major Jones, who before he leaves the district, may be enabled to obtain further
            particulars."</p>

         <p>Musquito Shore. Intelligence has been received, that in some trivial dispute with a native Indian, a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto, and then fled. The nation to
            whom the Indian belonged, being made acquainted with the murder, sent a deputation to the Governor, demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This
            was peremptorily refused, as being more than commensurate to the offence, but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly, and departed, vowing the
            severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed, the
            Spaniards were flying, with the utmost precipitation and terror, from all parts of the country, seeking shelter in the forts.</p>

         <p>Norfolk, April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion, John Simmons, master, in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried
            away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch, one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught, and belonged to
            Greenock.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio, to his relation inWinchester, Virginia. dated April 13, 1791.</p>
         <p>"I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were
            informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river, and one to a boat going up to a French station, loaded with bacon, butter, &amp;c. The particulars relative to
            the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing, they gave the
            Indian whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat, but did no damage, as it required some time to make their way into the river.
            After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity, they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days, five or six boats happened to come
            down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them, in which were two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, a young gentleman, and some others, passengers, and took it. Elevated with
            this easy capture, they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight, which they attacked with great fury–they were
            in three canoes, each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat, as it came down, and commenced firing; after discharging their guns, they retreated, loading and came on a
            second time, fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on, there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat, which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two
            were killed, and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat, and prevent the Indians from boarding it, which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave
            fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ???, they threw billets of wood at them, and one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of defence, should they
            persist in boarding, which the Indians perceiving, and, as is supposed, their ammunition being expended, they retreated, without accomplishing their object.</p>
         <p>"These inhuman monsters, previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat, placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes, in which situation they were both killed. A few days
            after this transaction, they fired at another boat, and killed one young man. In short, every boat tat has gone down the river lately, has been fired at, except our's. We saw no Indians;
            the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night."</p>
         <p>Boston, May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston, lost 25,000 dollars in the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of conscience.</p>
         <p>Salem, May 31. His excellency our worthy overnor perceiving, with his usual discernment, that Lotteries have a tendency to withdraw the people's attention from industry, the only certain
            source of wealth and prosperity; and also that they operate as a??? ??? ???, ??? ???and embarrassed being??? the ??? aventurers; suggests, in??? ??? the Legislature, the propriety of
            discontinuing this mode of raising money.</p>
         <p>The states of Connecticut and New Hampshire have passed laws, prohibiting the sale of lottery tickets of other states, in their states.</p>
         <p>Bennington, May 30. A gentleman from the northward informs, that the part at the British post lately holden in this state, has recently been recalled.</p>
         <p>Baltimore, May 27. Colonel Jacob Webb, and Captain Miller, formerly of Stamford, in Concecticut, Mr. John Carmel, of Philadelphia, merchant, and several other gentlemen, with a negro boy,
            were drowned, on the 9th of March last, in St. Mary's river (Georgia) occasioned by the oversetting of a boat, in a sudden flaw of wind.</p>
         <p>Boston, May 25. On Friday last, the venerable Mr. John Simonds, of Salem, entered the one hundredth year of his age. He is the only male person who has arrived at that great age from the
            first settlement of the town by the English, in 1629, to the present day.</p>
         <p>New York, June 9.</p>
         <p>General Washington, on his tour to the Southern Sates, landed at Charlestown, South Carolina, in a barge decorated for the purpose, with colours and pendants, and rowed by twelve American
            Captains and a Cockswain, all dressed in blue silk jackets, black silk breeches, white stockings, and blue roses to their shoes. They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus, with
            the motto, Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay, and on board the vessels in the river, which, as well as works, saluted him with several discharges
            of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:–</p>
         <p>" Right Worshipful Sir, "We the Master, Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge, No. 2 of Newbern, beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three ! We approach you not with the
            language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother, the skilful and expert Craftsmen, the just and upright Man.</p>
         <p>But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy, the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and
            devoutly pray, that the Providence of the Most High, may strengthen, establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours, by
            command of our divine grand master, and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation, may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from
            the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels, as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of
            the brightest lustre."</p>
         <p>To which the President returned the following answer:– " Gentlemen, "I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me, with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed
            at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens, it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved,, by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and
            benevolence.</p>
         <p>In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address, be persuaded, that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness."</p>
         <p>George-Town. April 30.</p>
         <p>Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, the ship Termagant, belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite this town, was discovered on fire. The inhabitants
            of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected, but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board, the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the
            flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the
            ship were flying in every direction, and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, store and dwelling houses, on the water side, were prevented from sharing a similar
            fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, the property of Francis and Charles Loundes, situated at some distance from the water, wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of
            tobacco were stored, was several times, in different places, on fire, ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss, occasioned by this alarming element, must be great
            indeed, as the ship was large and nearly new; besides, there were goods to a considerable amount, and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the
            money, which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin, which by some
            means or other, set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.</p>
         <p>Pittsburgh, May 21. A letter received in this town, on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at Fort Franklin, mentions, that an Indian had arrived there, who brought him intelligence that 300
            warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio, near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but their
            destination was not known.</p>

            of getting free of the Indian war by treaties.</p>
         <p>We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York state by a majority of 180, but the friends of Mr. Tay were objecting to the return, as the canvassers had not
            opened the boxes which contained the returns from three counties, Otsego, Clinton, and Tioga, which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr. Tay, the county of Otsego alone
            being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay.</p>
         <p>A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July, which continued with so much violence, that several vessels were driven from their moorings, and a number of boats upset and many

         <p>A complete overthrow has lately been given to a numerous body of Indians, commanded by one of their greatest Warriors, who was left dead on the field, amongst many hundreds of his
            followers.</p>
         <p>The attack was commenced on the morning of the 28th of June, by a company of Regulars under the command of Lieutenant Morton of New York, aided by a number of the neighbouring inhabitants;
            and after a contest of three hours, put them totally to the rout. The carnage was general amongst the Indians, and no quarter given, as it might operate as a terror in future to those
            savage Freebooters, whose depredations on the property of every description of individuals and oftentimes??? with personal cruelty to those in their power, has exasperated the Communities
            to the highest pitch of vengeance and retaliation when an opportunity offered.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Luxene County."On Saturday the 1st of July, I left Tioga point, near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from
            the north west, and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore, Esq; at Sheshequen, before the storm came on, attended with heavy thunder and lightening, and a
            violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued upwards of half an hour, during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm, was surprising. After it abated I continued
            on my journey, but found it very difficult travelling in many places, the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm
            extended through the country, and at the same hour of the day, blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter, about nine miles from Wilksbarrie, a level plain loaded with pitch
            pine timber, was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length, and three fourths of a mile wide, being either torn up by the roots or twisted off, leaving their
            stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.</p>
         <p>"A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs, and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed, and many fields of corn, others grain and flax laid
            level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country.</p>
         <p>"A Mr. –Lot, who lived at Mahooper, about 35 miles from Wilksbarre, whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in
            danger in the house, left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door, and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about
            expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke, another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow, two other slightly
            wounded."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Richmond, Virginia, dated July 28.</p>
         <p>"By accounts from Kentucky we are informed, that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort, and took a great number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with
            300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river, leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles, overtook a large
            party, when a severe engagement ensued, but being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind, and came up with the Indians the next day, and after
            engaging some time, obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors, two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit, and all the negroes and horses."</p>
         <p>Newtown, June 27.</p>
         <p>On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown, was removed about eight rods, the removal was effected in one hour and an half, after previous preparations for the purpose had been made.
            The house is between 70 and 80 feet long, and about 50 feet wide, with a steeple at one end; the whole of which was removed entire, with the least injury to any part.</p>

         <p> Each day brings additional strength to the report of a rupture with America. The representations which have been very forcibly urged by the American Minister, Mr. Pinckney, include
            various topics of complaint. Amongst these are, the withholding of the poste of Niagara, Detroit, &amp;c. in violation of the treaty of 1783; the exciting of the Creek and other Indians to
            make war upon the American frontier; the refusal to make compensation for the property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwallis, &amp;c in the Southern States, according to stipulation;
            the seizure of American ships bound to France; the impressing of American citizens to man our fleets; and finally, the sullen silence which the British Minister is alledged to have
            uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by the Republic.</p>
         <p>The American Minister has, however, so little hope of efficacy from these representations, that he has ordered in his tradesman's bills, and made every other preparation for an abrupt
            departure.</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding this a??miny aspect of affairs, we still must hope, that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between America and Great Britain will
            ensue; for illjudged and ignorant, indeed, of the true interests of his country must that Briton be (whatever his rank( who would advise another American war –a war which, reasoning of the
            future by the sorrowful experience of the past, can only serve to increase the sum, and to swell the catalogue of human woe.</p>

         <p>ANOTHER DREADFUL MASSACRE BY THE NATIVESOF THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS. (From the Sydney Gazette, Nov. 8. 1815)</p>
         <p>By the Governor Macquarrie, are arrived Captain Fowler, and part of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in August 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent and
            Eastern Islands, and from thence to China, but was cut off and plundered, on the night of the 10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the
            Marquesas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and the
            wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift, by which means she drove on shore through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives
            saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise
            among the different natives towards one another, when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore, through stress of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
         <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief, or king, Nooahetu, who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld
            his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel– The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand, as well as by gesticulations
            that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed to many other chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in
            rank, were very far superior in number, supported by the common usages of the island, from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated, with his son
            by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people, as it was not a hereditary right, but an elective dignity.
            His people pressed their solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words, which not
            seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated,
            on the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to the chief
            next in command, who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive: he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other which he had
            entwined around his own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed
            perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these unoffending
            people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the
            untaught man may possibly excel his fellow - creature, whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly
            upon their king, whose person they adored, because that his principles were good, and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of strangulation had been
            imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; The mandate which had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and, commanded to
            perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The King! the King!" from every lip burst forth–'What! kill the King! No,
            no, let all the strangers live–no man shall kill the King!" Thus were their lives preserved, and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Noorheva, still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the natives, who have a thorough knowledge
            of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war upon the ruling chief. The rebels are denominated the typees; and the
            opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each other. Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the following
            detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion: A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain of
            death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not
            yet coagulated.</p>
         <p>The chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to Europeans, is named Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe, and the latter signifying great. The
            dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women. The
            chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe of which,
            extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice the chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the
            ship's bottoms there than he has any where else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes, some of which contain from 80 to 100
            warriors. They are anxious after every kind of property carried among them for barter, and this is supposed their chief inducement for attacking vessels, when they can do so with a
            probability of accomplishing their object.– They have no knowledge of the use of muskets, and have none among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who
            resided among them about fifteen years ago in a Missionary capacity, describes them as a people constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes for taking advantage of
            strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he remarked to some of them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing at the same time, that its inhabitants were less
            numerous:–" Can't we go and take them?- What is there to hinder us?" was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of their natural inclination to hostility, in which,
            all accounts respecting them correspond.</p>

         <p>ANOTHER DREADFUL MASSACRE BY THE NATIVES OF THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS. ( From the Sydney Gazette, Nov. 8, 1815.) </p>
         <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and part of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in August, 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent and
            Eastern Islands, and from thence to China; but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the
            Marquesas, on a sandal wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and the
            wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives
            saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death, which appears to have been a constant practise
            among the different natives towards one another, when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore, through stress of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
         <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, or King, Nooahetu, who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld
            his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel. The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand, as well as by gesticulations
            that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed by many other Chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in
            rank, were very far superior in number, supported by the common usages of the island, from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated, with his son
            by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people, as it was not a hereditary right, but an elective dignity.
            His people pressed their solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words, which not
            seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated
            upon the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to the Chief
            next in command, who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other which he had
            entwined around his own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed
            perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these unoffending
            people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the
            untaught man may possibly excel his fellow creature, whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly
            upon their King, whose person they adored, because that his principles were good, and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of strangulation had been
            imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; the mandate that had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed: and commanded to perform
            the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey–when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The King! the King!" from every lip burst forth:–"What! kill the King! No, no,
            let all the strangers live–no man shall kill the King!"–Thus were their lives preserved and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the natives, who have a thorough knowledge
            of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war upon the ruling Chief; the rebels are denominated the Typees; and the
            opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the adverse party were killed, and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the following detestable
            circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain of death,
            impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet
            coagulated.</p>
         <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to Europeans, is named Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe, and the latter signifying great. The
            dress, of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women. The
            Chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe of which,
            extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice the Chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the
            ships' bottoms there, than he has anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes, some of which contain from 80 to 100
            warriors. They are anxious after every kind of property carried among them for barter, and this is supposed their chief inducement for attacking vessels when they can do so with a
            probability of accomplishing their object. They have no knowledge of the use of muskets, and have none among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who
            resided among them about 15 years ago in a missionary capacity, describes them as a people constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes for taking advantage of
            strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he remarked to some of them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing, at the same time, that its inhabitants were less
            numerous:–"Cannot we go and take them? What is there to hinder us?"–was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of their natural inclination to hostility, in which, all
            accounts respecting them correspond.</p>

            next in command, who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other, which he had
            entwined round his own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and my people, and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed
            perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed; and then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these unoffending
            people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the
            untaught man may possibly excel his fellow-creature, whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly
            upon their King, whose person they adored, because that his principles were good, and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient Chief, to whom the order of strangulation had been
            imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; the mandate that had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to perform
            the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey–when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The King! the King!" from every lip burst forth– "What! kill the King! No, no,
            let all the strangers live –no man shall kill the King!" Thus were their lives preserved–and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the natives, who have a thorough knowledge
            of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war upon the ruling Chief; the rebels are denominated the Typees; and the
            opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the adverse party were killed, and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the following detestable
            circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain of death,
            impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet
            coagulated.</p>
         <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to Europeans, is named Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe, and the latter signifying great. The
            dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women. The
            Chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe of which,
            extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice the Chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the
            ships' bottoms there, than he has anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes, some of which contain from 80 to 100
            warriors. They are anxious after every kind of property carried among them for barter, and this is supposed their chief inducement for attacking vessels when they can do so with a
            probability of accomplishing their object. They have no knowledge of the use of muskets, and have none among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who
            resided among them about 15 years ago, in a missionary capacity, describes them as a people constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes for taking advantage of
            strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he remarked to some of them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite; observing, at the same time, that its inhabitants were less
            numerous:–"Cannot we go and take them?–What is there to hinder us?"– was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of their natural inclination to hostility, in which,
            all accounts respecting them correspond.</p>

         <p>British Vessel plundered by the Natives of the Marquesas Islands. [ From the Sydney Gazette, Nov. 8, 1815.]</p>
         <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and part of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in August 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent and
            Eastern Islands, and from thence to China; but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the
            Marquesas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and the
            wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives
            saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise
            among the different natives towards one another, when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore, through stress of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
         <p>Capt. Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, or King, Nooahetu, who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld
            his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel. The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand, as well as by gesticulations
            that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good Chief was opposed by many other Chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in
            rank, were very far superior in number, supported by the common usages of the island, from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated, with his son
            by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people, as it was not an hereditary right, but an elective dignity.
            His people pressed their solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words, which not
            seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated
            upon the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to the Chief
            next in command, who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other, which he had
            entwined round his own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my Chiefs and my people, and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed
            perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed; and then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these unoffending
            people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of admiration, in which the
            untaught man may possibly excel his fellow-creature, whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly

         <p>Each day brings additional strength to the report of a rupture with America. The representtations which have been very forcibly urged by the American Minister, Mr. Pickney, include various
            topics of complaint. Amongst these are, the withholding of the poste of Niagara, Detroit, &amp;c. in violation of the treat of 1783; the exciting of of the Creek and other Indians to make
            compensation for the property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwalis, &amp; in the Southern States, according to stipulation; the seizure of American ships bound to France; the
            impressing of American citizens to man our fleets; and finally, the sullen silence which the British Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by
            the Republic.</p>
         <p>The American Minister has, however, so little hope of efficacy from these representations, that he has ordered in his tradesmen's bills, and made every other preparation for an abrupt
            departure.</p>
         <p>Not withstanding this alarming aspect of affairs, we still must hope, that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between American and Great Britain will
            ensue; for ill-judged and ignorant, indeed, of the true interests of his country must that Briton be (whatever his rank) who would advise another American war –a war which, reasoning of
            the future by the sorrowful experience of the past, can only serve to increase the sum, and to swell the catalogue of human woes.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, Septemper 10, 1821</p>
         <p>"Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans, and not as many born in the country;
            the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery than in any town of the size
            in the world.– There are some few splendid houses, but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as in all
            American towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as if turned out
            of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general, with fever–their habits and
            manner of living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out
            in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at
            home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours, and
            excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the
            evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, and dress; every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite at
            good as her neighbours, and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy, from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a
            plunderer, a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady can read or write, or use a
            needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to priestcraft, it
            reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is covered with churches, some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of
            Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage, it will produce six millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war, not a dollar will they have. The exports of Peru, in
            ordinary times, were five millions of dollars in pecie, and one million in produce. Mininng may be carried to any extent, it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good government.
            People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar."</p>
         <p>"Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to Upper Peru, is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all
            in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa, (two bladders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for
            money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety hours, offering them any price for their
            tropical fruits.</p>
         <p>"I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to
            his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the chandelier; the house filled
            with smoke.</p>
         <p>"There are 82 titled families, mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year, Peru will be the most wretched country on the
            globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire, and exterminate all other colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– 25,000 in Lima and adjacent
            village, the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.</p>
         <p>"About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace, the
            produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is continued to little
            vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town, half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left
            to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they will not work, and famine must ensue."</p>

         <p>LANDS in AMERICA for SALE.</p>
         <p> THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the County of FAYETTE and State of KENTUCKY. The one track consists of 7000 acres, and is divided into 15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of
            these plantations, are still unsold, and are now offered at the low price of 137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track counsists of 3086 acres, and is to be sold in one lot, at
            5s. 6d. per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through these two tracks of land, which communicates with the great river Ohio, so that Mills may be erect.</p>
         <p> In Fayette County is Lexington, where the Courts of the State of Kentucky are held, and where all public business is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these lands, and
            Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient for Philadelphia, Baltimore, City of Washington, &amp;c. The soil of Kentucky is deep and black, and lies upon a bed of lime-stone and
            coal. THe natural grown of the country are large walnuts, honey, poplar and sugar trees. The surface is covered with blue grass, clover, and wild rye, grape vines running to the tops of
            the trees. Shrubs and plants grow spontaneously, and afford a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are manufactured to advantage. wheat ,barley, oats,
            flax, and hemp, yield abundantly; indeed, it is assumed that there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre, but the common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre.</p>
         <p> Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil, and fine climate of the country, no part of America has been to repidly settled. The returns made to Congress, upon 1st May 1792 state them at
            76 000. In March 1793, there were upwards of 100,000. And, from their astonishing increase since, they may be estimated at 200,000. Eleven years ago, Kentucky lay in a forest, but now she
            exhibits an extensive settlement, divided into seven populous counties, in which are a great number of flourishing towns, and contains more inhabitants than are in Georgia, Delaware, and
            Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Kentucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and Schools are established in every town. There is a Printing-office; a Weekly
            Gazette published. There are Paper Mills, O??? Mills,???ing Mills, Saw Mills, and a great number of Grist Mills. Considerable quantities of Sugar, are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works
            are in every part of the country, and the inhabitants are supplied at a low price.</p>

         <p> As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York, Nov. 6, gives an impartial account of the situation of that counttry, we are
            persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers.</p>
         <p>Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives, IT is some aba???of the satisfaction, with which I meet you on the present occasion, that in felicitating you on a
            continuance of the national prosperity, generally, I am not able to add to it information that Indian hostilities, which have for some time past, distressed our western frontier, have
            terminated.</p>
         <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less concern than I communicate it, that reiterated endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous
            proofs of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to
            arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation, for peace, has led to strenuous efforts, through various channels, to accomplish these desirable puposes:–In
            making which efforts, I consulted less my own anticipations of the events, or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the object
            attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, the such is the case.</p>
         <p>A detail of the measures which have been pursued, and of their consequences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of success, thu s far, will, I trust,
            evince that means, as proper and as efficacious, as could have been devised, have been employed. The issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; but a favourable one, though not to
            be despaired of, is not promised by any thing that has yet happened.</p>
         <p>In the course of the attempts which have been made, some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected, even among savages, has
            been found, in this instance, insufficient to protect from massacre, the emissaries of peace; it will I presume, be duly considered, whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of
            liberality towards the families of the deceased.</p>
         <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed, what besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threatening symptoms have of late been revived
            among some of those south of it.</p>
         <p> A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the ??? river, have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring
            settlements.</p>
         <p> It was hoped that the treat of Holston, made with the Cherokee nation, in July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The
            Chickamagas, aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton and unproved hostilities, upon the citizens of the United States in that
            quarter.</p>
         <p> I have reason to believe, that every predictable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war,
            in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised, have been recruited, though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been
            taken to discipline, and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards
            a pacific termintion of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement, from the proper department, with regard to the number of troops raised, and some
            other points which have been suggested, will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and, among other things, will enable Congress to judge whether some
            additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.</p>
         <p>In looking forward to the future expence of the operations, which may be found inevitable, I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the
            present year, is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community, for the service of the ensuing year. This however, will be better ascertained in the course of
            the session; and it is proper to add, that the information alluded to proceeds from the supposition of no material extention of the spirit of hostilities.</p>
         <p> I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our
            interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all ??? plans must prove nugatory. To enable by ???ent rewards the employment of qualified
            ??? persons to reside among them, as agents, would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients, an eligible plan could be
            devised for promoing civilization among the friendly tribes, and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants, and under regulation calction, its influence in
            cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.</p>
         <p> The prosperous state of our revenue had been intimated–This would be still more the case, were it not for the impediments which in someplaces continue to embarrass the collection
            of???duties on spirits, distilled within the United States.</p>
         <p>These impediments have lessened, and are?ess???din local extent; and as applied to the community at large, the contentment with the lawapp??? to be progressive.</p>
         <p> But symptoms of increased opposition have lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; I judged special interposition on my part, proper and adviseable, and under this impression
            have issued a proclamation, warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings, having for this object, or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question, and announcing
            that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in excution, for bring to justice the infractors thereof, and securing obedience thereto.</p>
         <p> Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured, that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend on me, shall be
            wanting???sert and maintain the just authority of the law. In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the government, and upon
            the zealous support of all good citizens.</p>
         <p>I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court, which will be
            laid before you, points out some of the inconveniences that are being experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws, considerations rise out of the structure of that system,
            which some cases,???to relax their efficacy. As connected with the subject provisions to facilitate the raking of???upon processes out of the Courts of the United States, and supplementary
            definition of offence, against the constitution and laws of the union,???of the punishment for such offences, will, it is presumed, be found worthy of particular attention.</p>
         <p> Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary; I would be wise, however, by timely provisions, to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to
            disturb it, and to put ourselves in a condition???give that satisfaction to foreign nations, which???may sometimes have occasion to require from them.</p>
         <p> I particularly recommend to your considerations the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens, on the territory of other nations, as other infractions of the law of nations,
            which furnishes just subject of complaint, might endanger our own peace with them. And, in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your
            attention???expiration of the law for that purpose which taken place, if not re???, at the close of the present session.</p>
         <p> In execution of the authority given by the legislature, measures have been taken for engagement of our mint–others have been employed at at home. Provision has been made of the requisite
            buildings, and therefore now putting into proper condition for the purpose of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half-dollars; the want of small
            coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.</p>
         <p> The regulation of some provision in the law, which establishes the Post Office, open to in experiment, against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should that,
            upon the enquiry, be found to be the fact, a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation, will, I doubt not, lead to the
            application of a remedy.</p>
         <p> The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky, has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the
            happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates, and conducive to the general order.</p>
         <p>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since my last communication on the subject, and in further execution of the acts, severally making provision for the public debt, and for the
            reduction thereof, three new loans have been effected, each for three millions of florins,—one at Antwerp, at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four
            per cent. in lieu of all charages.–The rates of these loans, and the circumstance under which they have been made, ar confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.</p>
         <p> Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied, the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers, according to the provision made during the last session,
            has been embraced.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, I entertain a strong hope, that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and
            effecttual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt, according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable,
            whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation.</p>
         <p> Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In
            fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, it is expected a valuable saving will be made.</p>
         <p> Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year, and for such extraordinaries as may require provision, will demand, and I doubt not, engage your early attention.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives , I content myself with recalling your attention, generally to such objects, not particularized in my present, as have been
            suggested in my former communications to you.</p>
         <p> Various temporary laws will expire during the present sesssion. Among these, that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, will merit your particular notice.</p>
         <p> The results of your common deliberations hitherto, will, I trust, be productive of solide and durable advantages to our constituentes; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate
            suffrage, will tend to strength and confirm their attachment, upon which, under Divine Providence, materially depend their union, their safety, and their happiness.</p>
         <p>Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends, there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful cultivatino of harmony, combined with a due regard to
            stability in the public councils.</p>
         <p>G. WASHINGTON.</p>

         <p>EXTRACTS FROM LATE NEWSPAPERS.</p>
         <p>New York, July 5.</p>
         <p> This city and its vicinity were exceedingly alarmed, last Sabbath, about four o'clock, M. P. by a tremendous westerly tornado, which continued about 20 minutes, twisting off limbs of
            trees, unroofing houses, and tumbling down chimneys in various parts of the city. Unused to such unruly gusts, the citizens, particularly the fair, were thrown into a momentary d???ation.
            Terrible was the havoc on the water–in vain did the Sabbath breakers cry for mercy–in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, were they hurried to the bottom, and melancholy was the scene.
            It is said that 29 persons lost their lives in this neighbourhood, but we have not been able to ascertain who they were for certainty. Report says, that a Mr. Wade, his wife and two of
            their children, his brother, and a young man, were all, except the last mentioned, drowned from one boat near Yellow Hook, a few miles from the city. It is also said, a sloop overset with
            16 persons, all but one of whom were drowned.</p>
         <p> We learn that the??? extended to Philadelphia, that ship was driven from her moorings there and sunk, and that the road from thence to this city, shrewn violent tokens of its
            visitation.</p>
         <p>July 14.</p>
         <p> The society for promoting the manufacture of maple sugar, met at Albany, July 3, have granted 75 dollars, bounty, to Thaddeus Scribner, of Herkermer county, for having produced 600 lb. of
            grained maple sugar, of superior quality– of 50 dollars to Comfort Cook, of Otsego, for producing sugar of equal quality, but a less quantity –and of 25 dollars to J. Harris, and R.
            Huntley, of Saratoga county, for the third rate quantity. The society resolved, to exhibit samples from each of these parcels to the legislature at their text session, in order to induce
            them to give larger bounties, for the further encouragement of this important manufacture.</p>
         <p>Aug. 4.</p>
         <p> On Saturday last, arrived in this city, directly from Scotland.–Nesbit, Esq. a gentleman who comes warmly recommended by the celebrated Dr. Robinson, and several other literary characters
            of eminence in that country, as a master of the science of canaling, from several years experience both in Holland and in Scotland.</p>
         <p> The President of the Northern Inland L.?.Company, attended by Mr. Nesbit, and a commitee of Directors, left this city, this morning on a tour, to explore the rive from Troy upwards, for
            the purpose of prosecuting the canals with spirit the remaining part of the season, and making preparations for its more active prosecution in the ensuing year.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, July 12.</p>
         <p> Accounts from South Carolina and Georgia, with regard to their prospects of the ensuing crops, are very unfavourable, no rains of any consequence having fallen in the more eastern
            disctricts of these states since the beginning of April; at which time the low country was, in a manner inundaed. The Indigo plantations, when the last vessels sailed, were almost
            despaired of, for the next crop, and the rice swamps promised not much better.</p>
         <p>July 18.</p>
         <p> We are sorry to learn from New York, that spirit of party, respecting a late election of Governor" of the State, has arisen to such a height as to have occasioned several duels a week. On
            Thursday morning last, Colonel W??? and Mr. Wilcocks, both of New York, had a meeting, and exchanged pistol shot, but their friends in???prevented any bad consequences.–Colonel Willet is
            friendly to Governor Clinton's election, which Mr. Wilcock opposes.</p>
         <p> We hear from Maryland that a number of gentlmen of the state are about establishing a society in Port-To??? for the dissemination of useful political knowledge, the study of the
            constitution of their country, and the keeping up among the people if possible, a knowledge of their rights as free citizens of the greatest, and perhaps the only, true republic in the
            universe.</p>
         <p>August 6.</p>
         <p> On Thursday morning, was witnessed a very melancholy event at Mr. Henry Kizer's power mill, in lower Merion township, Montgomery country, between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large
            quantity of powder in the mill, which by accident took fire and blew up with a great explosion, which was heard at Schuylkill ferry, and was there supposed to be an earthquake. Mr Kizer,
            and three others who were in the mill, were blown to pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a copartner of Mr. Kizer, was so wounded that his life is dispared of. A young woman who happened to be
            near the mill at the time it blew up, had both her legs broken, and was otherwise very much injured, by one of the rafters which was carried from the building in the violence of the
            explosion.</p>
         <p>Petersburgh, July10.</p>
         <p> We learn from North Carolina, that a fire broke out in the town of Washington, on Wednesday the 27th ult. which burn nearly half the town.–The loss in houses, goods, &amp;c. is said to be
            very considerable.</p>

         <p>"The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men and one woman, and stole seven horses between the states of Crays Creek and Col. Shepherd's in Ohio county, Virginia.–Lieut. Gray and fourteen
            of my men followed them over the Ohio, as far as the head of the Soufish, but the Indians being on horseback they returned without coming up with them. On Saturday last, at Dilly's station
            opposite the mouth of Grave creek, the Indians came into one of the houses and killed four and wounded one; the number of Indians was suppos ed to be twenty. It is thought they will strike
            this quarter. To-morrow morning I intend to start with a party to try and fall in with them."</p>

         <p> We are informed, that one day last week, a Mr. Barret, living near the South Branch, accidentally shot his wife;–he was fixing a flint to his gun, and incautiously dragging the trigger,
            not knowing the gun was loaded, discharged the whole contents into her body, and she died in a few moments after–the unfortunate woman had a young child at her breast, but it

         <p>Extracts from the New-York Daily Advertiser.</p>
         <p>Pittsburgh, Sept. 7.</p>
         <p>SUNDAY last arrived an express in this town from the commissioners who were sent to treat with the Indians: he had left the commissioners on this side of Lake Erie, that day eight days.
            They had been met at Niagara by Indian commissioners, and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit, where our commissioners were
            directed to remain, until an asswer should be brought from the great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought
            to this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the impossibilities of
            doing this, as the lands had been sold by the Congress, and people had settled on them, but that the United States would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other
            time. The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled, the would leave the land, and remove the difficulty. Our commissioners
            replied that the land they must have, and would not give it up. The Indians said it was well, and there need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper until
            they returned to the council, and laid this before them. On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country in question or
            war. The express is of opinion from the language of individual Indians in private, and from other circumstances, that the British wholly conduct their council, and dictate their
            demands.</p>
         <p> By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last, we are informed, that the Indians still contiue hovering about our garrisons, and occasionally stealing horses, that the
            army is in high spirits, anxiously waiting the event of the treaty, and hoping that a campaign will take place, as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; that the greatest pains has
            been taken by the commander in chief, in training his men in the act wood fighting, and that from their proficiency, and the???imity prevailing throughout the whole army, success may be
            expected should a campaign take place.</p>
         <p>New York, Sept. 17.</p>
         <p> A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to Governors Island, where he died this morning. He arrived from Philadelphia last Thursday, was seized with Fever on
            Friday.–The Doctors pronounced it the malignant putrid fever, and the event prov ed their opinion to be just.</p>
         <p> According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that from August 1, 1792 to August 1, 1793, the Births amounted to
            2511, and the Death to 1467."</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, Sept. 21.</p>
         <p> The stages for New-York returned to this city, with all the passengers (mortified and fatigued.) One of the drivers had a very narrow escape with his life, being cruelly fired upon at
            Trenton; the ball passing within a few inches of his head! The ladies, &amp;. have been without any refreshment on the road, as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed, by
            the writings and measures above alluded to, prevented their obtaining any accommodations on the road– O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in the streets of Askelon ! Ye New Yorkers and
            ye Baltimorians, you have been generous to strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due to your own fellow-citizens!"</p>
         <p>Sept. 25.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his city, on his way to the southward.</p>
         <p>"We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men, who used us with every indignity and hatred, truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in the stage from five
            to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during this interval, one of these ruffians, who appeared to be a German, snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to
            leave the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the road; this guard, in their tender mercy, wre pleased to hand us a piece of dry cheese, on the end of a pitch-fork.
            After this quarantine, we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden, and there to perform another, for the space of two days and nights."</p>
         <p>New-York, Sept. 28.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in Baltimore, dated the 20th instant.</p>
         <p>"You request I would endeavour to give you a parti cular account of the state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here.</p>
         <p>"I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois, in a vessel which came to a wharf betwen Arch and
            Race-street, beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel, and it was afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several families thereabouts. But most
            people apprehended it to be the general fall-fever, which acted severly on those who had the influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton, in
            Vine-street, who after a short illness, died about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever, and each person became after of his
            neighbours, insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided, and many fled from the sick, leaving them in adestitute situation, perhaps shut up in a house, and the neighbours alarmed,
            merchants and housekeepers moved into the country, and fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing
            up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country, and searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became
            alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn ?hat it spread there.</p>
         <p>"The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy, and several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their post, and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. Finding deaths
            increasingly abundantly, they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in Water, Front, Race and Vine-street, threatened desolation in those
            quarters. The overseers, moved by the distresses of the helpless, took possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital, employed some physicians and nurses; sent
            out some accomadations, and provided for interring the dead.</p>
         <p>"The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in number, and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses, two and three dollars per
            day, most of the magistrates fled; the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people, who had been private patientes
            on the poor list, abandoned and had no sheltering place, and those who were slightly indisposed, were sent to Bush-Hill and became victims with many others.</p>
         <p>"The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement, and a committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital, and to relieve the distressed in the city and
            its vicinity they became organized, Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank, two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill properly conducted;
            bedsteads were procured, the house cleaned, matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an apothecary, with medicine, &amp;c. and four physicians to attend once a day.</p>
         <p> The remainder of the committee attend at the State House, receive information from the committee at Bush - Hill, and supply their demands; receive all sheets, shirts, &amp;c. &amp;c. at
            the State-House, also keep a supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors
            pronounce to have the fever, of disposing the corps,and for carrying provisions and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up, and under the care of a
            matron, to be for the use of those children whose parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to
            be open for their use, and they to be accountable to him for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary, and business at a stand; deaths numerous, and no parade at the interment of
            any; the bells do not ring, nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance, but it cannot be ascertained with
            precision; and we think between 15 and 20,000 removed from their habitations.</p>
         <p>"The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how that is I know now."</p>
         <p> By a passenger, arrived from Albany this morning, we learn that, in order to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany, they have formed Committees, and fixed a Gun-Boat at
            some distance from the city, where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers– And, that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived, but were denied admittance into the
            city, and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's, at Green-Bush.</p>
         <p>October 2.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia, to the Printers of this PAper, dated September 28.</p>
         <p>"The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy situation of this city, for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of
            late Pit digging, where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the most accurate observations I can make upon matters, I think I speak within bounds, when I
            Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of August, in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I
            confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present, and it will take some time to have accurate returns made.</p>
         <p>"People have been hitherto so panic struck, that little has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; nothing but the yellow
            fever is talked of; the street are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted, the markets miserable and uncommonly high, and nearly one half the citizens departed. The city
            is truly republican; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disadpeared, and bad Plato himself come among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim, his lectures could not
            have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the present mortality.</p>
         <p>"We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion, than not going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired, clean, and frequently having the walls, white-washed.
            considering the general terro, I have more than once felt my pulse, to discover whether I was really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape, as cool weather is fast
            approaching, and one-street in general healthy.</p>
         <p>"Of all things, this yellow fever is the most insidious– its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely, and die
            in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of a person, it does not easily let him get off.</p>

         <p>Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell, Esq. Speaker of the Senate of this commonwealth, a gentleman of a benevolent disposition, an improved mind, a sound understanding, and an honest
            heart.</p>
         <p>Died, on Friday evening, after a short illness, with the present maligant fever at Mrs. Grant's,–Mr Chase a yong gentleman of respectable connections of Baltimore.</p>
         <p>Winchester, Sept. 20.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from our correspondent at???Creek Territory, South of the Ohio, dated Sept. 4.</p>
         <p>"Times here were but a gloomy aspect. The???le daily harassed by the Indians. On the 27th of August a party, consisting of about 300, killed Lieut. Janks Tedford, of the United States
            troops, and a Mr. JAckson, as they were gathering corn in a field for their horses, near Henry's stations–They have lately burnt many houses on the Nine Mile, and destroyed a prodigious
            quantity of wheat, rye and corn. WE hope Governor Blount on his return to this territory, will be invested with power to desstroy these barbarous tribes."</p>
         <p>From the same, dated Sept. 14.</p>
         <p>"On the 30th of August, some Indians killed one young woman and scalped another, in Washington county; and on the 5th instant, a part of them wounded four persons, and scalped one, about
            nine miles from Green Court - House; a house was also attacked by them, but they were forced to retreat by the owner thereof and one of his daughters, who fired several rounds, and wounded
            some of them. On the 16th, another party of the savages killed a woman and child, on Nine-Mile."</p>
         <p>New-York, Oct. 16.</p>
         <p> Monday evening last, a number of persons assembled in the fields, when they commenced the demolition of Mother Cay's house, which in a short time was intirely resed to the ground floor;
            the furniture, beds, clothing, &amp;c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted by Mother Giles, under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons were wounded, one
            dangerously, from the firing of small arms, by some persons who were placed in the house for its defence.–We lament that our worthy Mayor, received some injury, in endeavouring to disperse
            the people.</p>

         <p> The following new cities, independent of innumerable small towns, have been lately begun to be built in America. The city of Washington, which, in the year 1800, is to be the capital of
            the United States; the city of Paterson, in the State of New Jersey; the city of Hudson, upon the North River, in the state of New York; the city of Columbia, which is now the capital of
            the State of South Carolina; the city of Martenberg, now the capital of North Carolina; the city of Knoxcille, in teh new district of Franklyn; the city of Nuskville, in the new district
            of Cumberland; the city of Lexington, and the city of Donxville, in the new State of Kentucky; and the city of Bennington, in the new state of Vermont. The ground is also marked out, and
            the lots are upon sale, for building one more new city, to be called Newport, on the river Potowmac, and another called Athens, on the banks of the Mississippi.</p>

         <p>FEDERAL LEGISLATURE.</p>
         <p>House of Representatives. Dec. 3.</p>
         <p> THE Secretary of the Senate announced, that the Members of the Senate were ready to admit the Members of the House of Representatives in the Senate Chamber, in order to receive the
            President's communication.</p>
         <p>FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
         <p> Since the commencement of the term for which I have been again called into office, no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizens at large, the deep and respectful sense
            which I feel of the renewed testimony of public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been
            honoured by my country; on the other, it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement, from which no private consideration should ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief,
            that my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives; and that the people, and the authorities derived from them, would support exertions having nothing personal for their
            object, I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the executive power; and I humbly implore that Being, on whose will the fate of nations depends, to crown with success our
            mutual endeavors for the general happiness.</p>
         <p> As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse with them might be
            interrupted, and our disposition for peace drawn into question, by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish our citizens
            of the consequences of a contraband trade, and of hostile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal state of things, an easier admission of our right
            to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under these impressions, the proclamation, which will be laid before you, was issued.</p>
         <p>In this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I resolved to adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privileges of the United States. These were reduced
            into a system which will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes, permitted by our treaty of commerce with France, to be
            brought into our ports; I have not refused to cause them to be restored, when they were taken within the protection of our territory, or by vessels commissioned, or equipped in a warlike
            form within the limits of the United States.</p>
         <p>It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve, or enforce this plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code, and the jurisdiction of the
            Courts of the United States to many cases which, though dependent on principles already recognized, demand some further provisions.</p>
         <p> Where individuals shall, within the United States, array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war, or enter upon military expeditions or enterprizes within the
            jurisdiction of the United States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked, or are inadequate; those offenses cannot receive too early
            and close an attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies.</p>
         <p>Whatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well administered by the judiciary, who possess a long-established course of investigation, effectual process, and officers in the habit of
            executing it.</p>
         <p>In like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, under particular circumstances, their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace, and even of a citizen of the United States,
            although seized under a false colour of being hostile property; and have denied their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory; it would seem proper to
            regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the executive is to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts
            ascertained by the courts, when, for his own information, he shall request it.</p>
         <p>I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world, without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of
            complete defense, and of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion, that, contrary to the order of human events,
            they will for ever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms, with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among nations, which
            will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; If we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful
            instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times ready for war. The documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount, and kinds of arms and
            military stores now in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected, as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a
            warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger.</p>
         <p>Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of Republican Government. They are incapable of abuse in the hands of the
            militia, who ought to possess a pride in being the depository of the force of the Republic, and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the United States.
            But it is an enquiry which cannot be too solemnly pursued, whether the act, "more effectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the United
            States," has organized them so as to produce their full effect; whether your own experience in the several States has not detected some imperfections in the scheme; and whether a material
            feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone.</p>
         <p>The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely interesting. The occurrences which relate to it ,and have passed under the knowledge of the Executive, will be
            exhibited to Congress in a subsequent communication.</p>
         <p>When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the Indians north of the Ohio. The
            instructions given to the Commissioners evince a moderation and equity; proceeding from a sincere love of peace, and a liberality, having no restriction but the essential interests and
            dignity of the United States. The attempt, however, of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated, the troops have marched to act offensively. Although the proposed treaty did not
            arrest the progress of military preparation, it is doubtful how far the advance of the season, before good faith justified active movements, may retard them, during the remainder of the
            year. From the papers and intelligence, which relate to this important subject, you will determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be compensated by
            succors of militia, or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits.</p>
         <p>An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with clothing, and offensive measures
            against them prohibited during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter, prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers
            which will be delivered to you, disclose the critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done.</p>
         <p> After they shall have provided for the present emergency, it will merit their most serious labours to render tranquillity with the savages permanent, by creating ties of interest. Next to
            a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace, the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States, is most likely to conciliate their
            attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion; with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians, and a stated price
            for what they give in payment and receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic, unless they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States
            to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress, they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the
            Executive.</p>
         <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
         <p> The commissioners charged with the settlement of the accounts between the United and Individual States concluded their important function within the limited time by law; and the balances
            struck in their report, which will be laid before congress, have been placed on the books of the Treasury.</p>
         <p>On the 1st day of June last, an installment of on million of florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of
            reimbursement, in nature of a new loan, at an interest of five per cent. for the term of ten years; and the expenses of this operation were a commission of three per cent.</p>
         <p>The first installment of the loan of two millions of dollars from the Bank of the United States, has been paid, as was directed by law. For the second it is necessary that provision be
            made.</p>
         <p>No pecuniary consideration is more urgent, than the redemption and discharge of the public debt: On none can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time more valuable.</p>
         <p>The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto, has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected to prove commensurate with all the objects
            which have been suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will therefore, it is presumed, be requisite: and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience
            of ourcitizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burdens.</p>
         <p>But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the government of the United States as the affections
            of the People guided by an enlightened policy; and to this primary good, nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings, diffused, without restraint,
            throughout the United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores, made during
            the recess will be presented to Congress.</p>
         <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
         <p> The several subjects, to which I have now referred, open a wide range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common country. Permit me to bring to your
            remembrance the magnitude of your task:–Without an unprejudiced coolness, the welfare of the government may be hazarded; without harmony, as far as consists with freedom of sentiment, its
            dignity may be lost.–But as the legislative proceedings of the United States will never, I trust, be reproached for the want of temper or of candour, so shall not the public happiness
            languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation.</p>
         <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, Dec. 3, 1793</p>
         <p>The President having withdrawn, the Members of the House of Representatives returned to their Chamber, where the President's Address was read, and referred to a Committee to report the
            draft of an answer.</p>
         <p>A Committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last House.–Adjourned.</p>
         <p>Thursday, Dec. 5.</p>
         <p>The Journal of the Commissioners for treating with the Indians was read. It is minute and lengthy. The definitive answer of the Indians contains their reasons for rejecting the proposals
            of the Commissioners, drawn up in a masterly manner, it bears all the appearance of EUropean logic, faintly clad in an Indian dress. All the documents relative to this business were
            referred to a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.</p>
         <p>A message was received from the President, communication sundry papers relative to our European relations, and also the result of the proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to settle
            the accounts of the United States with the Individual States.</p>
         <p>The first set of papers is introduced by a message, of which the following is a copy:</p>
         <p>United States, Dec. 5, 1793 GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
         <p>As the present situations of the several nations of Europe, and especially of those with whom the United States have important relations, cannot but render the state of things between them
            and us; matter of interest ing enquiry to the Legislature, and may indeed give rise to deliberations to which they alone are competent, I have thought it my duty to communicate them
            certain correspondencies which have taken place.</p>
         <p>The Representatives and Executive Bodies of France have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this country; have given advantages to our commerce and navigation, and have made
            overtures for placing these advantages on permanent ground; a decree however of the National Assembly, subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried into their ports and making
            enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend, contrary to our treaty, though revoked at one time, as to the United States, has been since extended to their vessels also, as has been
            recently stated to us. Representations on this subject will be immediately given in charge to our Minister there, and the result shall be communicated to the Legislature.</p>
         <p>It is with extreme concern I have to inform you, that the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipotentiary here have breathed nothing of the
            friendly spirit of that nation which sent him; their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in a war abroad; and discord and anarchy at home. So far as his acts or those of his
            agents, have threatened our immediate commitment in the war, or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws, their effect has been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the laws, and
            by an exertions of the powers confided to me. Where their danger was not imminent, they have been born with, from sentiments of regard to his nation, from a sense of their friendship
            towards us, from a conviction that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a person who has so little respectedour mu tual dispositions, and, I will add, from a
            reliance on the firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace and order. In the mean time, I have respected and pursued the stipulations of our treaties, according to what I
            judge the true sense; and have withheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from us, and which justice to others let us free to perform. I have gone further;–rather
            than employ force for the restitution of certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to restore, I thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties, by avowing it to be my
            opinion, that if restitution were not made, it would be incumbent on the United States to make compensation. The papers now communicated will more particularly apprize you of these
            transactions.</p>
         <p>The vexations and spolitation understood to have been committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers and officers of some of the belligerent powers, appeared to require attention.
            The proofs of these however not having been brought forward, the description of citizens supposed to have suffered were notified, that on furnishing them to the Executive Power, due
            measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past, and more effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents be furnished ,proper representations will be made thereon,
            with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh exigency of the case.</p>
         <p>The BRitish Government having undertaken by orders to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain generally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their own ports and those of
            their friends, the instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our Minister at that court. In the mean time, some discussionson the subject took place between him and them;
            these are also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their present sessions.</p>
         <p>Very early after the arrival of a British Minister here, mutual explanation on the execution of the Treaty of Peace were entered into with that Minister; these are now laid before you for
            your information.</p>
         <p>On the subjects of mutual interest between this country and Spain, negociations and conferences are now depending. The public requiring that the present state of those should be made known
            to the legislature in confidence only, they shall be the subject of a separate and subsequent communication.</p>
         <p>G. WASHINGTON</p>
         <p>Mr. Madison reported the draft of an Answer to the Address of the President.</p>
         <p>The remainder of this sitting was employed in beginning the reading of the papers received from the President, which are voluminous.</p>

         <p>United States, June 4, 1794.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives,</p>
         <p>Lay before Congress the copy of a letter, with its enclosure, from the Secretary of State to the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty; it being an answer to a letter from the
            Mnister to him; bearing date the 22 ult. and already communicated.</p>
         <p>GEO. WASHINGTON.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, June 2, 1794.</p>
         <p>SIR.</p>
         <p>If, the letter with which you honoured me on the 22d ult. had not entered into a train of recrimination against the United States, I should not now trouble you with a return to its
            unpleasant topics. Among the reasons, which would have induced me to add nothing to my letter the 1st of lat month, its would have been of some weight that by silence I should avoid the
            repetition of a style and manner, which seem to have produced a personal excitement.</p>
         <p> As you are willing to admit the authenticity of Lord Dorcester's speech, we will, with your approbation, reserve for a future discussion, on what occasion, and to what degree, an
            explanation may be required by the government of the United States from a foreign minister.</p>
         <p>I selected only one passage of that speech, because in it was concentrated the real object of the whole; which was to declare an expectation, that Great Britain would be at War with the
            united States in the course of the present year. and, if she were, to cause the warriors to draw a line. this is the undisguised sense of the governor-general, unaffected by the
            preliminary words, which you have thought proper to quote. It is your own interpretation. For so far are you from contradicting my assertion, that Lord Dorchester fostered and encouraged
            in the Indians, hostile dispositions towards us, that you continue the greater part of your remaining observations to vindicate his persuasion and your own, that the principal aggression,
            leading to hostility, proceeded from the United States and to suggest many others of the same tendency, upon which you would not dilate.</p>
         <p> I shall not shrink, Sir, from your charges.</p>
         <p>1st Notwithstanding the territory, upon which certain inhabitants of Vermont are presented in your letter of the 5th of July, 1792, to have trespassed, belong to the United States; yet on
            the 9th of the same month did my predecessor give you, as is admitted, positive assurances of the determination to discourage and repress the subject of your complaint. The necessary
            instructions were accordingly forwarded to that state. On examining your correspondence with my department, it does not appear that from the 9th of July, 1792, to the 10th of March, 1794
            upwards of nineteen months, our government ever unrdestood from yourself, or any authority ofhis Britannic Majesty, that the original dissatisfaction continued. Nor was any discontent
            heard from that quarter through other channels, except what related to outrages upon our own citizens by British subjects. Then, indeed, thirty days after the hostile tribes of Indians had
            been assembled by Lord Dorchester, at Quebec, you renewyour remonstrance. Although it cannot be by any means believed, that this was written, in order to ausher in the intelligence, which
            soon after arrived on his speech; ye tit is difficult to account for so long an interval under the circumstances supposed. Nor ought my answer, although delayed for fifty days, until the
            19th of April, 1794, to be constured into an assent to any charge, since at the end of that period, having been disappointed, as my letter shews, in one opportunity of information, and no
            other presenting itself, we were not in a capacity of contradicting your assertions. However, Sir, the instructions, issued in consequence of your application, conveyed positive orders for
            the correction of what, upon examination, should be found irregular.</p>
         <p>2d, Among the points, to which you intimate that you might have adverted, is enumerated the fitting out of two privateers at Charleston, South Carolina. Whatever this transaction might
            have been, it probably occurred at the commencement of the war, and before the existence of the war was communicated to our government, by any of the powers engaged. Had such a transaction
            been known to the President in time, you can well judge from his actual conduct, what he would then have done. His proclamation on the 2nd of April, 1793, his call upon the state governors
            on the 26th of the same months, to co-operate with him in the work of impartiality and peace; the system of rules which he established, and which were imparted to you, are unerring
            indications of the spirit of those measures, on which he had determined. He suppressed the consular courts, which attempted to pass sentences of condemnation on captures; he restored
            several vessels to British owners; prosecutions have been instituted against the violaters of neutrality. In a word, Sir, what has been required, under the sanction of the law of nations,
            which had not been fulfilled? How many thingshave been spontaneously done, to evince our impartiality? Let me request you to review my predecessor’s letters to you of April 22, May 15,
            June 5, August 7, 8, 25, September 5 and 12, 1793: and to say if more could be well expected from us? After such demonstrations, it might have been hoped, that the equipment of these two
            privateers would not rise again in the shape of a charge. But the letter of the 5th of June being conceived of itself to be satisfactory, is here inserted.</p>
         <p>"In the letter which I had the honour of writing you on the 15th of May, in answer to your several memorials of the 8th of that month, I mentioned that the President, reserved for further
            consideration, a part of the one which related to the equioment of two privateers in the port of Charleston. The part alluded to was that wherein you express your confidence that the
            executive government of the United States would pursue measures for represeeing such practices in the future, and for restoring to their rightful owners any captures which such privateers
            might be bring into the ports of the United States."</p>
         <p>"The President,after a full investigation of this subject, and the most mature consideration, has charged me to communicate to you, that the first part of this application is found to be
            jest, and that effectual measures are taken for preventing repetitions of the act therin complained of; but that the latter part, desiring restitution of the prizes, is understood to be
            inconsistent with the rules which govern such cafes, and would therefore be unjustifiable towards the other party</p>
         <p>"The principal agents in this transaction were French citizens. Being within the United States, at the moment a war broke out between their own and another country, they determine to go in
            its defence; they purchase, arm, and equip a vessel, with their own money, man it themselves, receive a regular commission from their nation, depart out of the United states, and then
            commence hostilities by capturing a vessel If, under these circumstance,the commission of the captors was valid, the property, according to the laws of war, was, by the capture,
            transferred to them; and it would be an aggression on their nation, for the United states to rescue it from them, whether on the high seas, or on coming into their ports. If the commission
            was not valid and consequently, the property not transferred by the laws of war, to the capture, then the case would have been cognizable in our courts of admiralty, and the owners might
            have gone thither for redress. So that on neither supposition, would the executive be justifiable in interposing.</p>
         <p>With respect to the United States, the transaction can in no wise be imputed to them. It was in the first moment of the war,ߝin one of the their most distant port.ߝbefore measures could be
            provided by the government to meet all the cases, which such a state of things was to produce, impossible to have known, and therefore impossible to have been prevented by that
            government.</p>
         <p>"The moment it was known, the most energetic orders were sent to every state and port in the union to prevent a repetition of the accident. On a suggestion, that citizens of the United
            States had taken part in the act, one who was designated, was instantly committed to prison, for prosecution; one or two others have been since named, and committed in like manner; and
            should it appear, that there were still others, no measures would be spared to bring them to justice. The President had even gone farther; He has required, as a reparation of their breach
            of respect to the United States, that the vessels so armed and equipped, shall depart from our ports.</p>
         <p>"You will see, Sir, in these proceedings of the President, unequivocal proofs of the line of strict right, which he means to pursue. The measures now mentioned, are taken in justice to the
            one part; the ulterior measure of seizing and restoring the prizes, is declined in justice to the other; and the evil, thus early arrested, will be of very limited effects; perhaps,
            indeed, soon disappear altogether."</p>
         <p> As to the permission from the governor of South Carolina, ??? ??? departures of ??? privateers ??? ???, you may assure yourself of a proper inquiry; and I take the liberty of requesting
            any evidence which you may have of it</p>
         <p> 3. With so many direct proofs in your hands, of the opinion constantly maintained by our government against the legality of captures in general made by illegal privateers, it is not
            easily explained, why the validity of those before the 5th of June, 1793, should be argued, from a refusal to restore them. The above received letter of that date, neither affirms nor
            disaffirms their validity; but declines the granting of restitutions being inconsistent with the rules which govern such cases. Those ruled are That if the commission be good, the capture
            is good; if the commission be bad, the capture is bad; but whether it be good or bad, is not decided; it being enough to prove, that the transaction, for the reasons assigned, can in no
            wise be imputed to the united States. But if captures of this kind, prior to the 5th of June, 1792, do really amount (as is conceived by some) to no very considerable value, this would of
            itself, lessen the importance of the insinuation.</p>
         <p>4th. The secretary of war has undertaken to ascertain the precise state of the privateers le Petit Democrate and la Carmagnole, and the result will be communicated to you. In the mean
            time, it is a matter of some surprise, that vessels, whose single employment and profit, must consist in cruizing on the ocean, should have remained in the port of New-York during the
            whole winter, and probably up to the date of your letter (May 22d, 1794) May it not be presumed, that their activity has been checked by the intervention of the government? But, sir, if
            they have not been dismantled, your letter brings the first notice of the omission.</p>
         <p> 5th. It is true, that the sale of prizes made by French cruizers, has not been prohibited in the United States, and that our treaty with France has been so interpreted, as not to
            contemplate a freedom to sell. The next resort was to the law of nations; which was scrupulously searched by the executive, with the pure desire of discovering truth and justice to all.
            Upon this, as on many other occasions, the civilians differ; Vattel declaring, That a privateer may carry his prize into a neutral port, and there freely sell it; Martens affirming the
            same doctrine, if it has not been otherwise regulated by treaty; and others opposing it. in this sxhism among the writers,it was resolved by the President of the United States, to impose
            no restraint upon those sales; and to refer them; as affairs of legislation, to congress, at the earliest moment of their session. Thus much has been observed, not as my final anser, but
            merely to introduce an assurance, that I will follow you in the main discussion, whensoever you shall bring it forward in detail.</p>
         <p>6th. Undoubtedly, sir, you have been misinformed, that the vessels of France have been permitted to depart from our ports, notwithstanding the embargo. As the history of the executive
            proceedings is neither long, nor entangled, it shall be frankly stated to you. As soon as the embargo was laid, expresses and advice boats were dispatched, to notify the officer of the
            customs and revenue cutters, and all others concerned in its execution. The resolution imposing it, involved all foreign nations; the instructions from the United States, favoured no
            nation, directly or indirectly. A French snow, La Camille, which had descended the river Delaware as low as New-Castle on her voyage, was stopped by an officer of the United States; and
            the President, adhering to perfect impartiality could not think himself justified, to gratify the Minister of the French Republic with a passport. Passports being kept under the special
            view of the President were issued only after his examinatino of each case, and the total number of them does not exceed twenty-six. Among them, was one to yourself; one to an agent who was
            sent to the West-Indies, upon a business connected with the late captures and condemnation in various British courts of admiralty; one to a citizen whose vessel was under trial in Bermuda,
            and who was anxious to forward the British instructions of the 8th January, 1794, with a hope of rescuing her from confiscation; one to the friends of Joshua Barney then in Jamica; twenty
            for the accomodation of several unfortunate inhabitants of St. Domingo, to some of whome our government was advancing money for their support, and who could no longer endure their
            separation from home; one to some other persons in peculiar circumstances, desirous of returning to the West-Indies; and in the last instance, one to the Minister of the French Republic.
            If, therefore, by any other passport, or permission; the embargo has been relaxed, it was unauthorized by the President, and unlawful. The distance of Hampton Road from this city, being
            more than three hundred miles, the officers of government, resident here, could not learn, at the moment, what was passing there. No intelligence of an official nature of any real
            importance. No complaint from any other foreign minister, or any othe rpseron, has since reached us. If, Sir, you should happen to possess the information, I ask it as a favour, of you, to
            designate, who granted the permission, and under what circumstances the French vessels left that road? An investigation, however, has been, and shall be pursued, on our part, without
            delay. If the law has been violated, it shall be vindicated; but a violation of law, is very remote from a permission of the government.</p>
         <p> 7th. The uniformly unfriendly treatment which the British officers are said to have experienced in the United States, cannot be answered, until it shall be more explicitly defined. Did
            this treatment break forth in words or actions, not cognizable by law? If so, no complaint can be offered to government. Or in words or action, which were so cognizable? Our courts are
            free to foreigners against citizens, and independent of influence. To yourself let me appeal, that on the representations, which you thought proper to lay before the President, in relation
            to the British consul at Baltimore, the British consul at Norfolk, and the commander of the DȰdalus frigate, the necessary measures were promptly adopted; the result has been transmitted
            to you, and no objection has been returned. Nor was the government backward in its interference in the late affair of Philadelphia. And these eing the only occurrences of the kind within
            my knowledge, i trust, that no example can be produced of government refusing to extend its protection on every seasonable occasion.</p>
         <p>8th. The events at Newport, in Rhode-Island are accurately detailed in the proceedings, which I have the honour of enclosing to you. Within the limits of the present letter, I cannot do
            more; as it might be an useless talk to detain you with remarks, when non of them might be adapted to the animadversions which you mediate. It is enough, therefore, for me to engage, that
            these animadversions, whenever they shall appear, shall receive particular attention.</p>
         <p>Although, Sir, your charges against the United States are sketched only; the impression, which may have been intended, cannot be counteracted too soon, by such general elucidations, as at
            a future day may be more minutely unfolded. But let these facts be as they will; are they indicative of a hostile disposition in the United States, and ought they ultimately to produce a
            state of war? This is not the place for us to retort our complaints. But compare them with the whole of your catalogue; and say, what may our feeling be? Yet we prefer peace.</p>
         <p>9th. As Lord Dorchester's endeavour to stir up the Indians against us, is without justification; so is the expedition of Governor Simcoe without pretext.</p>
         <p>That you have received no intelligence of such an event having actually occurred, leaves room to conjecture, that you may not be without intelligence of it having been designed; and that
            it has therefore probably taken place. But you insist that much will depend on the place intended for the fort. Let the point allotted for it on the Miami, be unknown; the place is for our
            immediate purpose adequatley market out by eing on the river. A single glance of the eye over the map, proves that its source is within the limits of the United States. In its whole length
            it is flanked on each side by our territory. Its very mouth is to the Southward of our line, as recognised by our treaty with his Britannic Majesty. On no part therefore of the rapids can
            a fort be built, but within out country.</p>
         <p>This being fixed, your argument is, that if the fort be for the purpose of protecting subjects of his majesty, residing in districts, dependent on the fort of Detroit, or of preventing
            that fortress from being straitened by the approach of the American army; the principle of statu quo, until the final arrangement of the point in discussion between the two countries shall
            be concluded, will strictly apply.</p>
         <p>To change by hostile movements the condition of a thing, concerning which a treaty is opened, not being consonant with the spirit of adjustment, the principle of statu quo has been
            generally adopted. The nearest point of the rapids to Detroit cannot be less than fifty miles. They have never been considered, they never could be considered, as appending to Detroit. But
            you proceed and say, tha tthe proposed assumption of territory may depend on districts, which depend on Detroit. It is too obvious to dwell upon the remark, that if Detroit which lies
            within the United States, becomes the first station from which a district may be generated, one encroachment may beget another ad infinitum. It will, however, be very acceptable to
            understand with accuracy, how much of our territory towards the Miami was actually possessed by the military establishment of Detroit at the time of peace. I mention the military
            establishment; because if any subjects of his Britainnic majesty reside beyond the line of actual possess, they are, as being within our limits, under our jurisdiction.</p>
         <p>To prevent the fortress of Detroit from being straitened by the approach of the American army, is either a new modification of the preceding idea, or founded upon a untenable suspicion.
            For the question must recur, are the rapids an appendage to Detroit? Were they connected with it at the peace? If convenience only were to be consulted, and a wide range of unsettled
            territory, by being suitable to the momentary circumstances of one nation, is to be transferred for that reason alone from another, which is the true proprietor, we might even then
            controvert the conveniency of the rapids to Detroit. If right be consulted, our right is complete. Is then our territory to be thus seized? Nay, more sir, I am authorized to say to you
            explicitly, that the American army has no instructions to straiten or annoy that post; and that if the descent on the rapids was dictated by this consideration, it ought to be discontinued
            without cause.</p>
         <p>I have the honour, Sir, to be with great respect, Your most obedient servant, EDM. RANDOLPH.</p>
         <p>Mr. Hammond, Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty.</p>

         <p>"I lay before you certain information, whereby it would appear that some encroachment as about to be made on our territory, by an Officer and party of British troops. Proceeding upon a
            supposition of the authenticity of this information, although of a private nature, I have caused the representation to be made to the British Minister, a copy of which accompanies this
            Message.</p>
         <p>"It cannot be necessary to comment upon the very serious nature of such an encroachment, nor to urge that this new state of things suggests the propriety of placing the united States in a
            posture of effectual preparation for an event, which, notwithstanding the endeavours making to avert it, may, y circumstances beyond our controul, be forced upon us. G. Washington."</p>
         <p>By a letter from Mr. Randolph, the American Secretary of State, to Mr Hammond, the information alluded to we find to be, "That Governor Simcoe had gone to the foot of the Rapids of teh
            Miami, followed by three companies of a British regiment, in order to build a fort there"ߝWhich Mr. Hammond, in his answer, rather qualifies than denies.</p>
         <p> In the debate in Congress, on taking off the embargo, several members said they had voted for the embargo, merely as a part of a general plan of retaliation upon Great Britain; but that
            as the more effential parts of that plan, particularly the prohibiting of all commercial intercourse between America and Great Britain had been over-ruled, the embargo was injurious only
            to the subjects of teh United States, and therefore ought to be taken off.</p>
         <p>In Philadelphia and several other ports, the masters and mates of American ships held meetings, and published resolutions, declaring that they would not put to sea, until they could be
            assured that their flag would be respected, and their persons protected from such indignities as many of them had lately experienced. This they did after the embargo was at an end.</p>

         <p>Philadelphia, June 3. [ Authentic.]</p>
         <p>Copy of a letter from General Wilkins, to Col. C. Biddl, dated Pittsburgh, 23 d May, 1794.</p>
         <p>"I this moment received yours of the 17th inst. I arrived about fifteen minutes ago from Le Boeuf, and left the detachment there well covered, and in good spirits. They have built, under
            my directions, two small block-houses, picketed in, which I think will render them sufficiently strong until the reinforcement goes under Capt. Denny.</p>
         <p>"The Indians I have conversed with still continue of the opinion that the British will make an opposition to the establishment at Presque Isle. There arrived at Cuslawago, while I was
            there, an Indian from Sandusky, where he had been left by the Senecas last fall sick;ߝhe says the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, M'Kee, and Elliot the Indian agent, (the two last
            refugees from this country) were visiting all the Indian towns in that quarter, and exciting them to continue their opposition to the Americans, and assuring them of support from their
            father the British monarch. He further adds that they were ready for fighting Gen. Wayne the moment he moved; and that the British were erecting garrisons at the Miami river. Heconfirms
            the accounts of the other Indians, that they were determined to oppose the establishment at Presque Isle."</p>
         <p>There were in the Port of Philadelphia on the 25th of May.</p>
         <p>62 Ships, 73 Brigs, 7 Snows, 60 Schooners, 42 Sloops. 244</p>
         <p>In the House of Representatives of the United States, Thursday June 5, 1794.</p>
         <p>The House, according to the order of the day, resolved itself into a committee of the whole House, on the report of the Committee, to whom was referred the remonstrance of the People west
            of the Alleghany Mountains, relative to the navigation of the river Mississippi, and after some time spent therein, Mr. Speaker resumed the chair, and Mr. Trumbull reported, that the
            Committee, according to order, had the same report under consideration, and come to a resolution thereupon, which he delivered in at the Clerk's table, where the same was twice read, and
            agreed to by the House, as follows:</p>
         <p>Resolved, That as it appear, from the communications of the Executive, that the right of the United States to the free navigation of the Mississippi, is now the subject of negotiation with
            the Court of Spain; and as it is the interest of the United States, and every part thereof, to come to an amicable adjustment of the right in that mode, rather than resort to any means
            constitutionally belonging to the Legislature, no farther proceeding should be had on the said remonstrance, during the present session of Congress.</p>

         <p>American papers are received, dated October, 4. 1794. They contain two letters from General Wayne to the American Secretary at War, giving an account of a severe action he had with the
            Indi ans, who were assisted by the volunteers and militia of Detroit on the 20th August, on the banks of the Miamis, in the vicinity of the British post and garrison at the foot of the
            Rapids.–The action was bloody, and he says, "our army was left in full and quiet possession of the field of battle, which terminated under the influence of the guns of the British
            garrison, as you will observe by the inclosed correspondence which passed between Major Camp bell Commandant and myself upon the occasion." He adds℃"We remained three days and nights on
            the banks of the Miamis, in front of the field of battle; during which time all the houses and corn fields were consumed and destroyed for a con siderable distance both above and below
            Fork Mia mis, as well as within pistol shot of that garrison, who were compelled to remain tacit spectators to this general devastation and conflagration, among which were the stores and
            houses of Colonel Mac kee, the British Indian agent and principal stimu lator of the war now exiting between the United States and the Savages.</p>
         <p> The American paper from which this account is taken, does not give the correspondence above alluded to, but concludes the article thus: </p>
         <p>"Besides the very important papers which we have been able to offer to our readers this day, the Executive, we understand, has received copies of a correspondence between the British Major
            Camp bell, and General Wayne. The Major begins it by inquiring of the General by what authority he came there. The General answers by requiring to know who gave Campbell authority to
            establish a fort at that place, it being within our side of the treaty boundary, and no such establishment there when that instrument was signed. We hope ere long our gallant General will
            give a good account of this Mr. Campbell."</p>

         <p>CORONER'S INQUEST.–An inquest was held yesterday evening, before Anthony Gell, Esq. at the Nag's Head, in Grange-court, Leicester-square, on the body of Ann Paris, an unfortunate young
            creature, of interesting appearance, not more than 17 years of age, who, it appeared, had been reduced by some unknown melancholy circumstance, to the most forlorn and destitute
            situations. It was stated in evidence, that she had taken her lodgings only seven weeks, and that during that time she had evinced the most wretched state of mind, and, on Thursday
            morning, urged on by the poignancy of her feelings, or derangement of her intellect, she swallowed a considerable quantity of laudanum. On the violence of her death-pangs coming on,
            medical air was sent for, but too late to be of any assistance, and in a short time she expired.–The Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of Lunacy.</p>
         <p>The history of this poor young creature is at once romantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a Monsieur Paris, who was well known in the commencement of the Revolution, and in which
            he suffered. Madame Paris, with her infant daughter, took refuge in this country; and in the ruin of her fortune, became a governess in a noble family in Scotland. After this she had a
            house in the New-road; and, about two years ago, died of the rupture of a blood vessel. Her daughter had been placed at an eminent boarding-school near one of the new squares; and on the
            death of her mother was placed under the guardianship of a Member of Parliament, who, with the most liberal and benevolent attention to her destitute situation, resolved to complete her
            education; and she had every master of eminence in all the elegant arts. She spoke French and Italian; touched the piano with great execution; sung with taste; and had read beyond her
            years.</p>
         <p>About six or eight months ago she was met in the square, when walking with the other young ladies, by a young man in the dress of a midshipman, who followed her to the door, and who wrote
            to her under the name of Jones. A correspondence took place. Her imagination was fired; and she eloped with him under a promise of marriage. His address was found in her box, and they were
            traced by her guardian, and separated. Jones declared that she was virtuous, and his intentions were honourable, and as a proof of it he was ready to marry her with her guardian's consent.
            In effect they were married and she was completely undone. In about a fortnight or three weeks Jones threw off his disguise, and fairly told her his real character– that he was no sailor,
            but lived by his shifts; that he had married her only for the sum her protector had paid him, and that she must provide for herself. She was abandoned; and the shock had such an effect on
            her imagination, that she has ever since shewed signs of a disordered intellect. With a heart that shrunk from vice, she was flung on the world without a friend or a home; and in this
            deplorable state she became the victim of necessity.</p>
         <p>About three weeks ago, she saw an officer, who is distinguished for his gallantries, and who by his address and attentions so won upon her affections, that she could neither speak nor
            think of any other object. This fatal attachment absorbed her whole soul. They entered into engagements to live and die only for one another; and in the frenzy of this passion, or under
            the idea that she could not be his, and his alone, she took the desperate resolution of dying for him. She had prepared three phials of opium, who of which she swallowed, and she died with
            a spirit of heroism; for no persuasion nor force could make her, when seized with the nausea of the poison, take any antidote to the draughts. She would not suffer the medical men to
            approach her–and though after stupefaction came on, they administered every known medicine, they all failed of effect.</p>

         <p> On Friday, an Inquest was held at the Nag's Head, Leicester-fields, on the body of Madamoiselle Ann Paris, then lying dead at No. 4, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-fields.– Sarah Upton
            deposed, that she is housemaid to the place. She had frequently observed that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be rather flighty and tiresome in her manner, such as ringing the bell
            violently, giving orders, and almost immediately after giving counter-orders; at other times she would ring with equal violence, and when any of the servants inquired what she wanted, she
            would tell them she wanted nothing. At one time the deceased gave the witness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness said, "Good God, Miss, you surely must be mad to think of
            such a thing; besides you know it is contrary to law, and I can't procure it." She then set down and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute; she had been used to take it for
            a pain in her bowels.–The witness replied, "Very well, miss, you may kill yourself, but I shall not give my assistance to the deed." On Wednesday, she went out at two, and returned at half
            after six o'clock. She then said, that she had given a coachman a 1 l. note at Brompton, she had to pay the man only 2s. but she would not wait for her change, as she thought it was much
            better to lose money than time. She went out about a quarter of an hour, after the time of her coming home, and returned again at eight o'clock, having her bonnet all bedizened with
            artificial flowers. She got a candle, went up to her own apartments, and returned in about seven minutes time; she refused to take tea with two ladies that were in the parlour at the time;
            she sat down at first in an extremely pensive manner, then, in the course of a minute or two, with the utmost wildness in her countenance, she exclaimed, "Oh, I shall never see him again!
            I have done the job–I have taken good care that the laudanum I took should do the business." The witness was instantly alarmed, knowing that the deceased had ordered her to get some
            laudanum for her before then. She ran up stairs in the utmost consternation, and saw the phials in the lady's chamber. Upon her return, she endeavoured to get some explanation for the poor
            young lady as to what induced her to commit such an act of desperation, but in vain–she looked wild, and continued raving for some time, and then fell into a state of stupefaction. Medical
            assistance was sent for; three Professional Gentlemen attended, but they could afford her no relief. She died before day light on Thursday morning. The witness knew nothing of any
            particular visitor to the deceased; neither had she the least knowledge of any of her relations or friends. The Jury returned the verdict– Insanity.</p>

         <p>Coroner's Inquest.–At half past two o'clock yesterday, an Inquest was held at the Nag's Head, Orange-court, Leicester-fields, before Anthony Gell, Esq. Coroner for Westminster, on the body
            of Madamoiselle Ann Paris, then lying dead at No. 4, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-fields.</p>
         <p>Sarah Upton deposed, that she is housemaid to the place; that the deceased had lodged about seven weeks in the house, during which time the witness attended more particularly than any
            other servant about the person of the deceased. She had frequently observed that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be rather flighty and tiresome in her manner, such as ringing the
            bell violently, giving orders and almost immediately after giving counter-orders; at other times she would ring with equal violence, and when any of the servants inquired what she wanted,
            she would tell them she wanted nothing. She was also extremely incoherent in her discourse, rambling from one subject to another with the utmost rapidity, and without there being the least
            connection between each.</p>
         <p>In answer to a question from one of the Jurymen, the witness said that the deceased was by no means in the habit of drinking, but that on the day on which the unfortunate affair took
            place, she thought the deceased appeared wild, as if she had been drinking.</p>
         <p>At one time the deceased told the witness that some one had said she was mad; another time she gave the witness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness said " Good God, Miss, you
            surely must be mad to think of such a thing; besides you know it is contrary to law, and I can't procure it." She then set down and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute;
            she had been used to take it for a pain in her bowels.– The witness replied, "Very well, Miss, you may kill yourself, but I shall not give my assistance to the deed." At other times, the
            poor young lady would be to all appearances in excellent spirits, when all of a sudden she would burst into tears, without any thing being said or done at the time to occasion it. She
            would sometimes fiddle with her clothes, like a person who was beside herself; she would collect a few flowers and deck her hair with them, and a thousand other little tricks that appeared
            to to the witness to be the most manifest proofs of a deranged intellect. On Wednesday, she went out at two, and returned at half after six o'clock. She then said, that she had given a
            coachman a 1l. note at Brompton, she had to pay the man only 2s. but she would not wait for her change, as she thought it was much better to lose money than time. She went out about a
            quarter of an hour, after the time of her coming home, and returned again at eight o'clock, having her bonnet all bedizened with artificial flowers. She got a candle, went up to her own
            apartments, and returned in about seven minutes time; she refused to take tea with two ladies that were in the parlour at the time; she sat down at first in an extremely pensive manner,
            then, in the course of a minute or two, with the utmost wildness in her countenance, she exclaimed, "Oh, I shall never see him again! I have done the job–I have taken good care that the
            laudanum I took should do the business." The witness was instantly alarmed, knowing that the deceased had ordered her to get some laudanum for her before then. She ran up stairs in the
            utmost consternation, and saw the phials in the lady's chamber. Upon her return she endeavoured to get some explanation for the poor young lady as to what induced her to commit such an act
            of desperation, but in vain–she looked wild, and continued raving for some time, and then fell into a state of stupefaction. Immediately on the unfortunate occurrence being known, medical
            assistance was sent for; three Professional Gentlemen attended, but they could afford her no relief. She died before daylight on Thursday morning. The witness knew nothing of any
            particular visitor to the deceased; neither had she the least knowledge of any of her relations or friends.</p>
         <p>Mr. Emanuel Gristock, of Wardour-street, surgeon, stated, that between ten and eleven on Wednesday night he saw the deceased; she refused all medicine that was offered her for the purpose
            of expelling the poison; with some difficulty, however, the witness forced part of an emetic down her throat; she said she new she had done wrong; and in disjointed sentences and in broken
            accents raved something about her loving a young man. Upon examining her apartment the witness found one small bottle full of laudanum, and two others empty, which evidently had contained
            the same sort of poisonous liquid; their contents must have been between two and three ounces. He left the patient at twelve, being under the necessity of attending another at Knights -
            bridge.</p>
         <p>Mr. James Wilkes, of the Haymarket, surgeon, saw the deceased at half after two on Thursday morning; she was then in a state of actual torpor, the nervous system appeared to be totally
            deranged, and she was incapable of making the least exertion with her body or limbs. She appeared to be past all hopes of recovery from the moment the witness saw her. However, having been
            previously apprised of the situations of the patient, the witness had taken a bottle containing an emetic in his pocket. With the utmost difficulty he forced part of it down her throat,
            but it had no effect–the patient continued in the same torpid state until five o'clock in the morning, when she expired. Dr. Hooper prescribed some other medicines, which we attempted to
            be administered, ut in vain; the patient was totally incapable of swallowing them.</p>
         <p>A jeweller had known the young lady for a considerable length of time; he had served her with a variety of trinkets in his line of business, and was in the constant habit of attending her
            two or three times a week. He had frequently observed the poor unfortunate young lady act with the utmost inconsistency and wildness; he had repeatedly known her to burst into tears in the
            midst of apparent merriment; he had known her to order clothes to dress for going out, then turn short and saw she would not go out that day; and he had known her once ,after sitting for
            some time in the most pensive mode imaginable, start up suddenly, and exclaim, "No, I will not stand this." She was between 17 and 18 years of age; he understood that she was born in
            France, but she spoke English as well as French. The day before the occurance of the melancholy transaction, which was the subject of the prevsent consideration of the Jury, she had, with
            frenzy depicted in her countenance, exclaimed, "Well, if my wishes are not fulfilled, I shall hang or drown myself." The witness had not the least knowledge of what she alluded to neither
            had he ever heard that she had any relations in London. He was most decidedly of opinion that she was deranged in her intellects.</p>
         <p>The Jury without a moment's hesitation, returned their verdict– Insanity.</p>
         <p>The history of this poor young creature is at once romantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a Monsieur Paris, who was well known in the commencement of the Revolution, and in which
            he suffered.– Madame Paris, with her infant daughter, took refuge in this country, and in the ruin of her fortune, became a governess in a noble family in Scotland. After this she had a
            house in the New-road; and, about two years ago died of the rupture of a blood vessel. Her daughter had been placed at an eminent boarding-school near one of the new squares; and on the
            death of her mother was placed under the guardianship of a Member of Parliament, who, with the most liberal and benevolent attention to her destitute situation, resolved to compleat her
            education; and she had every master of eminence in all the elegant arts. She spoke French and Italian; touched the piano with great execution; sung with taste; and had read beyond her
            years.</p>
         <p>About six or eight months ago, she was met in the square, when walking with the other young ladies by a young man in the dress of a midshipman, who followed her to the door, and who wrote
            to her under the name of Jones. A correspondence took place. Her imagination was fired; and she eloped with him under a promise of marriage. His address was found in her box, and they were
            traced by her guardian, and separated. Jones declared that she was virtuous, and his intentions were honourable; and as a proof of it he was ready to marry her with her guardian's consent.
            In effect they were married, and she was completely undone. In about a fortnight or three weeks Jones threw off his disguise, and fairly told her his real character,– that he was no
            sailor, but lived by his shifts; that he had married her only for the sum, her Protector had paid him, and that she must provide for herself. She was abandoned; and the shock had such an
            effect on her imagination, that she has ever since shewed signs of a disordered intellect. With a heart that shrunk from vice, she was flung on the world without a friend, or a home; and
            in this deplorable state she became the victim of necessity.</p>
         <p>About three weeks ago she saw an officer, who is distinguished for his gallantries, and who by his address and attentions so won upon her affections, that she could neither speak nor think
            of any other object. This fatal attachment absorbed her whole soul. They entered into engagements to live and die only for one another; and in the frenzy of this passion, or under the idea
            that she could not be his, and his alone, she took the desperate resolution of dying for him. She had prepared three phials of opium, who of which she swallowed; and she died with a spirit
            of heroism; for no persuasion nor force could make her, when seized with the nausea of the poison, take any antidote to the draughts. She would not suffer the medical men to approach
            her–and though after stupefaction came on they administered every known medicine, they all failed of effect.</p>

         <p>??? the new duties established by Congress ??? on goods are the same through all the ??? States, are so trifling are they in comparison of the taxes placed in any part of Europe on goods
            imported from Britain–many are only a 1-half per cent, and the highest ??? percent. Some very few articles excepted ??? clearly point out, that without British ??? customs they cannot
            subsist. Our merchants ???ly are exporting immense quantities of these to the Thirteen United States, not only from London, but from Liverpool, Bristol, &amp;c. it is doubtful but that
            many of the adventurers ???de may be obliged to bring back their ??? sell them far below their cost in England and thereby ruin themselves.–It is a pity Government could put a stop to

         <p>"A matter has lately happened here, which may perhaps be attended with serious consequences. There is a little island called Flat Island, near the Island of St. Martin's, which Sir Gillies
            Payne claims; he lately sent a few negroes there, who with a white man, were driven off by the French. A complaint has been made to Lieutenant-Governor Nugent, who means to know from the
            Baron de Clugny, whether he avows the fact; if he does, probably it may bring an open rupture, as out troops and ships may be sent down to protect it."</p>

         <p>The American Congress have laid on port duties, which may be deemed moderate in several particulars, when compared to those of most of the European kingdoms and cities, and in many
            instances are much less than heretofore imposed by the Provincial Assemblies. This may be hugly prudent in a republic which is courting commerce for her ports and for such a variety of
            articles, the native products of that extensive region, to give in return for fabrics not yet manufactuted among themselves. Their tobacco, corn iron, hemp, flax lumber, &amp; are
            inexhaustible sources of wealth, and their fisheries very considerable.</p>

      <titular>Extract of a letter from Philadelphia, July 10.</titular>
      <texto>
         <p>"From some late communications it is evident, that as much sugar may be made on the new lands in the States of New-York and Pennsylvania as will supply the whole United States, and perhaps
            in a little time furnish an article of exportation. The profits of the manufactory of sugar, when made by private families, will be greater than when made by large works. A boiler, which
            will cost only 16s. will be the whole expence that will be necessary to carry on this business, and the sugar may be made at a season of the year when no work can be done upon a farm. The
            price of it, when sent to Philadelphia, will be twice as high as the same quantity of wheat. The sugar trees may be made to yield their juice without being injured, and when they decay,
            fresh ones may easily be cultivated in the soil upon which they now grow. When we consider the value of sugar, its general and wholesome use in diet, and above all, that it has hitherto
            been obtained at the price of the lives and liberty of our African brethren, we cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens upon the prospect of manufactories of that article being
            established among us, whereby immense sums of money will be saved to our country, and, what is more, our country freed from the guilt of encouraging the detestable traffic in human
            creatures.</p>
         <p>"Several hundred sugar-kettles, we hear, are now making in New Jersey, for the use of the the New England settlers of the Susquehannahand Delaware."</p>

         <p>A short Description of, and Remarks upon a new State called The Western Territory, being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774.</p>
         <p>THAT no nation can serve the Americans with good equal in quality and price to Britain, is what the whole world knows, and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny:
            It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform our readers, that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since
            the beginning of their rebellion, viz. Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana, and The Western Territory.</p>
         <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago, lay in forest wild, it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has
            been the population, that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, in each of these States. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year 1789, and
            contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States, published in American in May last, we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of
            them, called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoiced the heart of every Briton to read it, and think, that the settling of these countries, though the Americans double their numbers
            every 15 or 20 years, will long keep them from manufacturing, and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman, even though wages are
            very high, when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thousand acres of land, that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of
            our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect, that new channels of commerce will be
            opened, and the inland parts of the Continent will require an incresing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by means of a most
            extraordinary inland navigation, will be diffused through a country more fertile, more susceptible of population, and six time more extensive, than all the Thirteen United States.</p>
         <p>The Western Territory</p>
         <p>Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi riverlb/&gt;–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania– south and south-east by the Ohio reiver;
            contains, according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, from which he deducts forty-three
            millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hunred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the foederal government, which is to be sold for the discharthe debt owing to the
            United States. But a very small proportion of theselands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*.</p>
         <p>On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements and already commenced*#x2013;one at Marietta, the other at Miami.</p>
         <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787, and already contains about 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhocking,
            Sioto, Miami, Wobash, &amp;c.–Coal and iron mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the soil is excellent–as rich as can be imagined, and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with
            little or no labour. It is exceeding healthy, pleasant, and commodious–the most fertile sport of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States.
            The timber is tall, and in great variety.–Streams for mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country
            will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties, and justify the descrpition of travellers, who call it the *garden of of a great empire will be
            fixed in some future pethe world*. It is here probably also that the centre riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accomodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with
            wild game of every kind; herds of deers, elks, bear, &amp;c. fill the extensive meadows of this country–turkies, geese, swans, and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The rivers are
            excellently stored with fish, and almost all navigable for small sloops.</p>
         <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory, they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30,000 persons' and when they acquire a certain
            degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States.</p>
         <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you, and you *only*</p>
         <p>*No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.</p>

         <p>By an extract of a letter from Jamaica we learn the following singular fact;–The Captain and crew of the brig Exuma, which arrived there some days before from Newfoundland, having in the
            course of their passage fallen in with a French schooner, Captain Alward asked the Captain of the schooner to accommodate him with some nails, which he politely did; at the same time
            begging his acceptance of some barracoutes caught that morning. Captain Aylward and his crew having dined off them the same day, they were immediately seized with violent sickness
            convulsive fits, and other dangerous symptoms. The Captain, judging that the fish they had eaten were of a poisonous nature, conceived that salt water might be of service, he instantly
            made the expedient on himself, which relieved him greatly ; he applied the same remedy to his crew and it was attended with good effects. When this unfortunate accident happened, it was
            luckily a dead calm ; had the weather been tempestous, it is more than probable the ship and crew would have been lost, as during their sickness, there was not a man able to stand by the
            helm.</p>

         <p>By letters received from Norfolk in Virginia, dated the 23rd of July, we learn that on the 10th of that month the ship Betsey of Greenock, Capt. James Young, had arrived there in 19 days
            from Jamaica, and brought the following melancholy relation which he received from the crew of the Prudence, whom she picked up on the 1st of Juin lat. 22. 40. long. 85. 32. That from the
            7th to the 10th of June the weather had been very hazy, with little wind, so that Capt Addies could not get an observation, and a strong current setting to the Southward and Westward,
            drove them farther leeward than they imagined. On the 12th, about 3 o'clock in the morning, the watch discovered Cape Catuloh, but before intelligence could be given to the Captain, she
            struck. For some time she made no water but about seven the water came in so fast, that by eleven o'clock, A. M. the water was six feet in the hold (the depth of the water in which she
            lay,) the people being sixteen in number, took to their long boat, and endeavoured to make Cape Antonie; but after four days fruitless labour they were obliged to return to the wreck,
            where they found two Spaniards plundering, who informed them that there were only four inhabitants on the island, and therefore they could receive no assistance from them; upon which,
            having taken a quantity of beef and biscuits aboard, they left the wreck a second time, and after having been absent fourteen days, were providentially picked up by the ship Betsey, and
            carried to Norfolk in Virginia.</p>
         <p>The Prudence was from Jamaica, bound to London, and had upwards of 500 hogsheads of sugar and rum on board.</p>

         <p>" A singular revolution has taken place at Martinique. The Governor, Viscount Damas, with the troops, had taken possession of St. Pierre's; having established peace, as they concluded,

         <p>On Friday died, at his seat at Cromford, the celebrated Sir Richard Arkwright, who introduced the spinning of cotton on Jennies. This gentleman was once a barber that shaved at a penny,
            but, by this abilities, raised himself to the state of immense opulence, and established the cotton manufacture, for which this country owes him the greatest obligation. It is said, that
            the profits of his works, for several years past, have amounted to forty thousand pounds a year.</p>

         <p>" There have been an amazing number of recruiting parties here these 8 days by gone, and I dare say they have got among them at least 200 recruits this week. Only in two or three
            particular instances have large sums been given–the bounty is generally from 5 to 6 guineas.</p>
         <p>" This place is at present full of people, many of whom may be said to have no more than what keeps soul and body together–I heartily wish they would also take away our loose women–they
            were never so numerous, nor so troublesome. If it was not for the recruiting service, and the prospect of a Bridewell, which it is hoped our Magistates will shortly set seriously about, we
            would have but dismal prospects before us the ensuing winter.–I am informed, government propose sending 2000 of our bad women–they would never be missed out of this place."</p>
